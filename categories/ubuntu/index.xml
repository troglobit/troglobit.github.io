      <title>HowTo play with SNMP</title>

      <description>This mini HowTo is about how you can use SNMP client tools to retrieve human readable information from devices running an SNMP daemon. In the examples below mini-snmpd is used as the daemon and as client both the command line net-snmp tool and the snmpB GUI are used.
Personally I use both Ubuntu and Debian, so the tools I use to download the clients will reflect that. See your respective UNIX distro&amp;rsquo;s help pages for how to install these client tools in your operating system.</description>

      <description>OK, so we finally got an iPad. The effective marketing droids of Apple are doing a good job, even the Linux zealots are starting to use their products :-)
So, how to serve the immense music collection of our family to the iPad? Well, it seems the magic integration with iTunes is not enough (yet), so you need a Simple Daap Client app on your iPad to get the most out of this HowTo.</description>

      <description>When you&amp;rsquo;ve installed Ubuntu 10.04 you might want to have the window controls back to the right side, where you&amp;rsquo;re used to having them. Use the following simple command:
gconftool-2 --set /apps/metacity/general/button_layout --type string &amp;quot;menu:minimize,maximize,close&amp;quot;  </description>

      <title>Ubuntu 8.10rc1 &amp;mdash; NetworkManager WTF?!</title>

      <description>I tried upgrading from Hardy Heron to Intrepid Ibex this weekend. Big mistake. If I disregard the total dpkg meltdown that I, as usually, had to resolve manually there still remains this recurring madness called Network Manager.
I&amp;rsquo;m an engineer. I have a masters degree in computer engineering. I have worked professionally with GNU/Linux since 2000 and been a die hard user of it since I left OS/2 behind in 1996.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had my ThinkPad T43 for a while now and I&amp;rsquo;m really pleased with it, everything just works! It took some pleading and, I admit, begging to persuade my boss and the IT department to buy it since they usually only buy from Dell or HP. This was mainly due to care packs and payment plans that these suppliers offer companies. My ThinkPad they had to actually pay for straight up.</description>

      <description>I think I&amp;rsquo;ve finally done it &amp;mdash; achieved my ultimate goal of combining the awesome powers of the Debian /etc/network/interfaces file with guessnet, wpa_supplicant, ifplugd and now also with netapplet!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a way to just point-and-click to select a different access point, both at home and at work. To that end I have a pretty advanced interfaces file that automatically detects where I am, what I am connected with (cable/wireless) and then, like magic, sets it all up.</description>

      <title>HowTo: Building Debian/Ubuntu Kernels</title>

      <description>I have been over this topic so many times now, strangely enough I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to make things more complicated than they need to be. It&amp;rsquo;s really this simple:
$ wget ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/Linux/kernels/v2.6/linux-2.6.19.2.tar.bz2 $ tar xfj linux-2.6.19.2.tar.bz2 $ cd linux-2.6.19.2/ $ zcat /proc/config.gz &amp;gt;.config $ make menuconfig [Tweak to your hearts desire] $ fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd kernel_image $ dpkg -i ../linux-image-2.6.19.2_2.6.19.2-10.00.Custom_i386.deb [DONE!]  You may, of course, need to tweak the file /etc/kernel-pkg.</description>

      <description>Dammit, tonight I spent too many hours chasing down a &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; in the Debian kernel build process or the Linux-2.6 kernel. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet deciced who to blame ;-)
Here goes: when you build the latest Linux 2.6 kernel, checked out from the git repository, with make-kpkg you should make sure to uncheck the CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO option in the kernel config before hand. It&amp;rsquo;s under &amp;ldquo;General setup&amp;rdquo; &amp;rarr; &amp;ldquo;Automatically append version information &amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;.</description>

      <description>About that /etc/network/interface autoconfig thingy: it&amp;rsquo;s almost done. Works perfect &amp;hellip; at work (connected) and at home (wireless). I need to fine tune the tests, I think, to get the connected stuff to work at home too. The problem seems to be that the test to see if the machine is connected at home is that the MAC it looks for to ID the office network also is available from home, via the VPN.</description>

      <title>Laptop Network Configuration in Debian/Ubuntu</title>

      <description>I have three network cards in my laptop. Two built-in and one PCMCIA card. I&amp;rsquo;m currently investigating how I can migrate from using the slow and tedious gnome-network &amp;amp; C:o tools to the more integrated Debian/Ubuntu tools ifupdown, guessnet, ifplugd and waproamd instead. As usual Debian has a fine and clever way of handling all this with their /etc/network/interface file. To learn more about this fine management interface I&amp;rsquo;m reading the well written book The Debian System by Martin F.</description>
