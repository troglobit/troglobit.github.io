      <description>There is a certain &amp;ldquo;burstyness&amp;rdquo; to the way I work on my open source projects. It seems it often coincides with intense work loads during new release cycles at work.
However, I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished restoring two pages that got lost in the big server crash:

      <description>Quite some time has passed now since our old site, http://vmlinux.org, crashed and burned, and with it much of my previous Open Source work and blogs. Tech blog entries, archives for the projects I maintain, lost.
Backups? Of course not.
This all happened in 2011. Since then we also managed to lose the domain and I kind of lost myself for a while, including my motivation.
Fortunately, at this point in time I had migrated most of my projects from CVS and Subversion to DVCS&amp;rsquo; like Bzr and GIT, so I could easily setup new homes for most of my Open Source projects at GitHub.</description>
