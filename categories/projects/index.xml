      <description>For some odd reason, today was the day when I woke up and continued working on libICMP. It&amp;rsquo;s now almost seven years since I first adopted Tim Lawless&amp;rsquo; public domain version, and today I picked up where I left off and started refactoring and cleaning up.
Example:
#include &amp;#34;icmp/icmp.h&amp;#34; int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { char *host = &amp;#34;localhost&amp;#34;; struct libicmp *obj; if (argc &amp;gt;= 2) host = argv[1]; if (!</description>

      <description>Today the new logo for Finit3 was added to the GitHub repo and the homepage
Gorgeous, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?! ðŸ•¶
This fancy artwork means we&amp;rsquo;re nearing the end of a long and agonizing release cycle where a lot of the internals of Finit have been rewritten and new exciting features have been added! More on this in an upcoming post ðŸ˜ƒ</description>

      <description>Sometimes I just cannot help myself. It&amp;rsquo;s like finding a stray puppy, or abandonded kitten &amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip; I recently decided to adopt mini-snmpd since the original upstream site had passed into the great beyond. At this point in my life almost everyone I know can tell you I have no warm fuzzy feels for SNMP, at all. So why did I even consider this to begin with?!
Well, I have to confess that there are certain things that SNMP can be really useful for.</description>

      <description>Summer is now slowly fading away, and what a summer it has been here in Sweden! For someone who isn&amp;rsquo;t a fan of the summer heat it has been an awesome time for brain work, and in my case work on my open source projects! :-)
Due to my not really taking much vacation previous years I had saved up for ten weeks (10) this year! It was really worth it, and for the first time in many years I actually feel rested.</description>
