      <description>Sometimes I just cannot help myself. It&amp;rsquo;s like finding a stray puppy, or abandonded kitten &amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip; I recently decided to adopt mini-snmpd since the original upstream site had passed into the great beyond. At this point in my life almost everyone I know can tell you I have no warm fuzzy feels for SNMP, at all. So why did I even consider this to begin with?!
Well, I have to confess that there are certain things that SNMP can be really useful for.</description>

      <description>So, we finally got Google Music &amp;amp; Movies services in Sweden! The prices seem a bit on the steep side, apart from maybe the Music service, which is slightly cheaper than Spotify. Will try it out for a month or so to see which one I like better.
For some reason I chose Gravity as my first rental, at 39 Skr. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard so many bad reviews of it but for better or worse it&amp;rsquo;ll now be my introduction to Google Movies :-)</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people ask me what I do for a living.  Usually I tend to
pause and think, real hard, becuase the people asking me this aren&amp;rsquo;t
programmers.  They use computers, but are mostly limited to a Windows
machine, writing in MS Word and browsing the Internet, mostly for
Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often start off with: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit complicated to explain &amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;, by
which time I&amp;rsquo;ve lost most of the people in the room listening to me.
Sometimes I say: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a software architect.&amp;rdquo;, because people seem to
know what architects do for a living, they draw houses, design stuff
and drive SAAB&amp;rsquo;s.  Much like dentists.  The prefix &amp;ldquo;software&amp;rdquo; however
does confuse people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>There is a certain &amp;ldquo;burstyness&amp;rdquo; to the way I work on my open source projects. It seems it often coincides with intense work loads during new release cycles at work.
However, I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished restoring two pages that got lost in the big server crash:
 mrouted pimd  Big thanks goes to the Wayback Machine for maintaining records of the original pages I lost!</description>
