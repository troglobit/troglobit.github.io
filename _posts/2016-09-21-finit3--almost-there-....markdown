Today the new logo for Finit3 was added to the GitHub repo and the
[homepage](/finit.html)

![Finit3 logo](/images/finit3.png)

Gorgeous, isn't it?! :sunglasses:

This fancy artwork means we're nearing the end of a long and agonizing
release cycle where a lot of the internals of Finit have been rewritten
and new exciting features have been added!  More on this in an upcoming
post :smiley:
