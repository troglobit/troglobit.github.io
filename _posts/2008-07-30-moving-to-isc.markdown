I hereby announce that all of the code I produce from now on will use
the [ISC license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license).  Previously
I've used the [MIT license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)
and the GNU GPL, or LGPL where applicable.

The reason for changing this is two-fold.  First, I like to be able to
reuse much of what I do in proprietary settings. Yes, I'm one of those
people who look upon the world with "grey" eyes rather than black &
white.  Second, the ISC license is a lot more clear on the wording but
is still GPL compatible.

OpenBSD also has some
[thoughts on the matter](http://www.openbsd.org/policy.html) which I
find interesting.
