Seriously, it's been one long winter and now finally summer is upon us
again.  It was about six months ago that I switched jobs and this is the
first time for that period that I've got ten minutes above the surface.
The [new job][1] is fun but currently takes up too much of my time to be
healthy in the long run.

Today we're going to [Stenby TV-service][2] with our broken Hitachi 32"
TV.  It broke down on the same day as the digital TV broadcast started
in our region.  Curious coincidence, huh?

Time passes quickly, in a couple of weeks my daughter turns three and my
son one year.  Still feels like yesterday they both were born.
