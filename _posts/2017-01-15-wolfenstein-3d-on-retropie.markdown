The last game I ever played was [Castle Wolfenstein 3D][1], released in
1992 for MS-DOS, made by the now legendary id Software.  OK, admittedly
I've played other games since then, but I've never again been so manic
about a game since Wolfenstein.

This post is about how to build, install and set up Wolfenstein 3D on a
Raspberry Pi running [RetroPie][2] ... on a [Picade][3] :-)

<!-- more -->

You need the original WAD files to play the game.  It's really worth
investing the money if you don't already have a copy.  Mount the CD, or
the CD image to `/mnt` on your Linux PC, the files are located in:

    mkdir ~/wolf3d
    cd /mnt/Install/data/WOLF3D/
    cp *.WL6 ~/wolf3d/

The `.wl6` files must be installed in `/usr/local/share/games/wolf3d/`
on the Raspberry Pi, with names in *lower-case*.  Use the following
command to rename them from upper-case:

    cd
    rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' wolf3d/*

Transfer the files to the Pi using scp, or similar:

    scp -r wolf3d pi@raspberrypi.local:.

On the Rasberry Pi:

    sudo mv ~/wolf3d /usr/local/share/games/

Now, download the game source from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/mozzwald/wolf4sdl.git
    cd wolf4sdl/

To build the game you need to install the SDL libraries, in particular
the `-dev` packages for both SDL and the SDL mixer:

    sudo apt install libsdl*-dev 

You may need to edit the file `version.h`, depending on what version of
the original game you have.  When done, build the game:

    make

To start Wolfenstein in RetroPie (Emulation Station), create the
following script and it will appear in the Ports section, like
Minecraft:

    cd ~/RetroPie/roms/ports
    vim Wolfenstein-3D.sh

Copy and paste the following lines:

    #!/bin/bash
    cd /home/pi/wolf4sdl
    /opt/retropie/supplementary/runcommand/runcommand.sh 0 "./wolf3d --res 640 480"

Remember to set the executable flag on the script before restarting the
Emulation Station GUI:

    chmod +x Wolfenstein-3D.sh

Done.

Restart and enjoy the game on your Picade like I do :-)
