I'm a coder, not a writer.  Here's what I've been working on during the
winter holidays:

* A new feature release of [Finit](/finit.html) is coming shortly, which
  will use [libuEv](https://github.com/troglobit/libuev) and feature
  inetd support built-in!
* Another minor release of my own take on event loops,
  [libuEv](https://github.com/troglobit/libuev)
  [v1.0.3](https://github.com/troglobit/libuev/releases/tag/v1.0.3).
  This time with a heavy focus on documentation and Q&A, extensive
  validation testing have been done on this release.
* Released another minor release of [mrouted](/mrouted.html),
  [v3.9.7](https://github.com/troglobit/mrouted/releases/tag/3.9.7),
  which despite its age, and all other obvious limitations of
  [DVMRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_Vector_Multicast_Routing_Protocol),
  is still one of the best options for *dynamic* multicast routing
  available today.
* Major new release of [pimd](/pimd.html),
  [v2.2.0](https://github.com/troglobit/pimd/releases/tag/2.2.0), which
  is likely the last release ever of the old pimd, unless someone starts
  paying me to work on it.

  ... or more people step up to help.  Both the Xorp PIM-SM and the
  upcoming Quagga PIM-SSM implementations are in better shape.  The only
  thing old pimd has got going for it is the license.  It's 3-clause
  BSD, so very liberal.

If you're interested in pitching in, on any of my projects, just send me
an email or connect with me on GitHub!
