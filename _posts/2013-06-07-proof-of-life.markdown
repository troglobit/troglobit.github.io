There is a certain "burstyness" to the way I work on my open source
projects.  It seems it often coincides with intense work loads during
new release cycles at [work](http://www.westermo.com).

However, I've just finished restoring two pages that got lost in the
big server crash:

   * [mrouted](/mrouted.shtml)
   * [pimd](/pimd.shtml)

Big thanks goes to the [Wayback Machine](http://www.archive.org) for
maintaining records of the original pages I lost!
