      <title>System &amp; Process Supervisor for Linux</title>
      <link>https://troglobit.com/projects/watchdogd/</link>

      <description>watchdogd(8) is an advanced system and process supervisor daemon, primarily intended for embedded Linux and server systems. By default it periodically kicks the system watchdog timer (WDT) to prevent it from resetting the system. In its more advanced guise it monitors critical system resources, supervises the heartbeat of processes, records deadline transgressions, and initiates a controlled reset if needed.
When a system comes back up after a reset, watchdogd determines the reset cause and records it in a file for later analysis by an operator or network management system (NMS).</description>

      <description>Finit is an alternative to SysV init and systemd, originally reverse engineered from the EeePC fastinit by Claudio Matsuoka — &amp;ldquo;gaps filled with frog DNA …&amp;rdquo;
Features include:
 Standard runlevels Starting processes in parallel Process monitoring (supervision) Sourcing environment files Pre/Post script actions Tooling to enable/disable services Runparts and SysV /etc/rc.local One-shot tasks, daemons, or SysV init scripts Dependencies, in Finit called conditions, e.g., start service network is up, or wait until syslogd has started Built-in getty with made-easy board-bringup support Built-in watchdog, with support for hand-over to watchdogd Built-in support for Debian/BusyBox /etc/network/interfaces Cgroups v2, both configuration and monitoring in initctl top Plugin support for extensive customization Proper rescue mode with bundled sulogin for protected maintenance shell  Some of these feature are presented below, for more, see the online documentation.</description>

      <title>The original multicast routing daemon</title>
      <link>https://troglobit.com/projects/mrouted/</link>

      <guid>https://troglobit.com/projects/mrouted/</guid>
      <description>mrouted is an implementation of the IPv4 multicast routing protocol DVMRP, RFC 1075. It is capable of turning a UNIX workstation, or Linux device, into a multicast router with tunneling support.
 Tunneling may be required to cross non-multicast-aware routers.
 The Distantance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP), derived from RIP, is suitable for smaller/dense networks. It employs the &amp;ldquo;flood and prune&amp;rdquo; method, where multicast is flooded until neighboring routers opt out from unwanted multicast groups.</description>

      <title>Minix Editline</title>

      <description>This is a line editing library for UNIX. It can be linked into almost any program to provide command line editing and history. It is call compatible with the FSF readline library, but is a fraction of the size (and offers fewer features).
The small size (&amp;lt;30k), lack of dependencies (no ncurses needed!) and the free license should make this library interesting to many embedded developers seeking a replacement for the GNU readline library.</description>

      <title>Mini SNMP daemon</title>
      <link>https://troglobit.com/projects/mini-snmpd/</link>

      <description>This is an SNMP server for small and embedded systems, currently Linux and FreeBSD are supported. It is easily portable to other UNIX systems since it&amp;rsquo;s written in C. The daemon is very small (~40 kiB) and does not have nowhere near the feature set of Net-SNMP, therefore it has a very low impact on system resources.
See my mini HowTo: Playing with SNMP for a quick introduction to setting up the SNMP tools and MIBs to avoid having to use numerical OIDs.</description>

      <title>Small and Simple DDNS Client</title>
      <link>https://troglobit.com/projects/inadyn/</link>

      <guid>https://troglobit.com/projects/inadyn/</guid>
      <description>In-a-dyn is a small and simple Dynamic DNS, DDNS, client with HTTPS support. It is commonly available in many GNU/Linux distributions, used in off-the-shelf routers and Internet gateways to automate the task of keeping your DNS record up to date with any IP address changes from your ISP. It can also be used in installations with redundant (backup) connections to the Internet.
Presentation here.
Supported Providers The following is a curated list of some of the natively supported DDNS providers.</description>

      <title>No nonsense FTP/TFTP server</title>

      <description>Tired of confusing configuration files and security features you don&amp;rsquo;t need?
Try uftpd!
 Supports FTP and TFTP No configuration file Defaults to port ftp/tcp and tftp/udp found in /etc/services, or custom port(s) Serves files from the ftp user&amp;rsquo;s $HOME, as specified in /etc/passwd, or custom path Can run from inetd(8) or as a standalone daemon Can be built and installed as a .deb file, with debconf support Can run as root, with chroot and privsep, or as a regular user Supports TFTP blocksize negotiation, RFC 2348  Basically, it just works!</description>

      <description>Merecat started out as a pun at Mongoose, but is now useful for actual web serving purposes. It is however not a real Meerkat, merely yet another copycat, forked from the great thttpd created by Jef Poskanzer.
Merecat expands on the features originally offered by thttpd, but still has a limited feature set:
 Virtual hosts Basic .htpassd and .htaccess support URL-traffic-based throttling CGI/1.1 HTTP/1.1 Keep-alive Built-in gzip deflate using zlib HTTPS support using OpenSSL/LibreSSL, works with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt!</description>

      <description>Nemesis is a command-line network packet crafting and injection utility for UNIX-like and Windows systems. Well suited for testing Network Intrusion Detection Systems, firewalls, IP stacks and a variety of other tasks. As a command-line driven utility, it is perfect for automation and scripting.
Nemesis can natively craft and inject ARP, DNS, ETHERNET, ICMP, IGMP, IP, OSPF, RIP, TCP and UDP packets. Using the IP and the Ethernet injection modes, almost any custom packet can be crafted and injected.</description>

      <title>The original PIM-SM daemon</title>

      <description>Protocol Independent Multicast, PIM, allows existing networks to route IP multicast, regardless of what unicast routing protocol is in use. It is designed to use existing routing tables to make its multicast routing decisions. PIM-SM is suitable for sparsely located multicast subscribers, for dense mode operation mrouted is recommended, and for static multicast routing smcroute may be used.
pimd is a lightweight standalone PIM-SM/SSM v2 multicast routing daemon. It is the original USC (netweb/catarina.</description>
