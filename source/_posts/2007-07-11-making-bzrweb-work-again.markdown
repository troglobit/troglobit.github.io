During the past weekend and the last couple of evenings I've been
studying the Python code in bzrweb &mdash; which I've been using for
online repository browsing.  It broke sometime last year due to not
keeping up with the development of bzr.  Yesterday I got it working
again!

* Browse: [http://vmlinux.org/jocke/bzr/][1]
* Branch: `bzr branch http://vmlinux.org/jocke/bzr/bzrweb`

Having only programmed Python very little earlier I must say that it's
really easy to get in to.  I usually hack scripts in sh or Perl, but
Python is really something that could be used for real programs.

I plan on doing some more bzrweb hacking later.  I'm not sure yet what
it'll be, but I guess a file-view would be useful, plus some minor CSS
cleanup.
