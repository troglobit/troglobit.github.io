I tend to return to this topic now and then, this time I postulate the
similarities between cooking and software development.  I say
"cooking" because I don't really know the correct terminology more
than what I've seen on TV and shows like Hell's Kitchen.  However, the
similarities are very telling, I think.

First, figuring out a menu is very similar to figuring out what
impression your software should give your users.  Considering
ingredients, what goes best together, composition and a general idea
of presentation.  This part is very important and cannot be skipped.
Brainstorming with other cooks, getting advice from sous-chefs on what
risks can be taken and where you should play it safe.
