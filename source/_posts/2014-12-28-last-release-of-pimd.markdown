On one of the last days of 2014 I release [pimd](/pimd.html)
[v2.2.0](https://github.com/troglobit/pimd/releases/tag/2.2.0), which
is an awesome release with a lot of new features and bug fixes!

However, it could very well be the last release I do.  Even though its
one of my most popular projects on
[GitHub](https://github.com/troglobit) I have not had enough time to
dedicate to it over the years.  I will continue to do fixes and merge
pull requests until someone else steps up to take over.  There is also
the distinct possibility that the
[Xorp PIM-SM](https://github.com/greearb/xorp.ct) or the new
[Quagga PIM-SSM](https://github.com/udhos/qpimd) implementations will
(finally) make good old pimd completely redundant.

At [work](http://www.westermo.com) we will likely start using the
Quagga PIM rather than pimd in WeOS.

For now though, enjoy pimd v2.2.0.  It's been tested in both my Qemu
based virtual testbed and a few setups using Linux' `netns` feature in
[CORE](http://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/ncs/products/core) -- awesome
little proggy! :-)
