Wow, this friday (June 12th) my daughter turned six!  I can hardly
believe it is six years since she came into our lives, time has gone by
so quick ... when she was born we still lived in [Västerås][1], now she
has a younger brother and we live in a great house in [Skultuna][2].

Happy birthday, Oona! I wish you all the best now that you're starting
first year of school after the summer vacation.  I know you're thrilled
about it, as are we, your proud parents. :-)
