Another release today is the venerable [mrouted](/mrouted.html), now
available as
[v3.9.7 on GitHub](https://github.com/troglobit/mrouted/releases/tag/3.9.7).

## Changes & New Features
- SNMP Support removed.  It never compiled and would have likely
  needed a complete refactor to support modern AgentX.
- Replaced static `config.mk` with configure script from pimd
- RSRR Support disabled by default, use `--enable-rsrr` to configure script
- Add `'enable'` to `phyint` directive and `-M/-N` command line options,
  thanks to Joseph Gooch (@goochjj)
- Add David Waitzman and Craig Partridge to list of original authors
  after being contacted by Mr Waitzman :)
- Change to use `stdint.h` types instead of type unsafe homegrown types

## Bug Fixes
- Fix issue with older BSD kernels, mainly for current FreeBSD 10 and
  older, that don't really give RAW sockets but byte swap `ip_len`
  field, Olivier Cochard-Labb√© (@ocochard)
- Build fixes for FreeBSD, should make maintaining ports easier :)
- Change from `select()` to `poll()` due to descriptor limits, e.g.,
  on BSD.
- UNIX 2038 first audit, inspired by OpenBSD.  Cleanup type confusion
  `int/u_long` where it should be `time_t`.  Also, clarify that `genid`
  is OK, since it's used and stored as unsigned 32-bit integer.
- Lots of minor fixes detected by Coverity Scan and Clang scan-build
