This is not only a reminder to myself, it is appraisal to the probably
best programming font ever: [Inconsolata][1].  Thank you so much, Mr
[Raph Levien][2]!

On the previous laptop I used [ProFont][3] quite extensively, but its screen
was only 1280x800, on the new laptop I have 1680x1050 and ProFont just
got too small for my aging eyes.
