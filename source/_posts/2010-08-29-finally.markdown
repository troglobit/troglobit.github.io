Compared to OpenBSD and FreeBSD the NetBSD install was hard, really
hard.  It wasn't until I stumbled across [this][1] that I managed to
convince myself to try it again.

The trick seems to be to ignore as much as you can from other Internet
tips.  NetBSD runs fine in KVM, so if someone says you need to run it in
Qemu mode &mdash; don't believe the hype.  OK, in `virt-manager` there
is no preset defaults for NetBSD, so I went with a generic OS and tried
starting the install from there.  The kernel hangs before it probes USB,
or it segfaults.

What I did was to stop the guest, and in the details view I disabled
ACPI and selected the pcnet NIC instead of the default `ne2k-pci`.
Running the default options in the NetBSD 5.0.2 installer, and the
bootloader after install, works fine.

If you still don't manage to get it running check the KVM home page for
[known bugs][2] and workarounds.  Sometimes it helps adding
`-no-kvm-irqchip` or `-no-kvm-pit`. However, `virt-manager` does not
seem to support these options yet, so you must run from the command
line.

Good Luck!
