      <description>It is with great pleasure I announce the next release of the editline library by Simmule Turner and Rich Salz! This is a popular library, it exists in several forked versions. This release marks the end of a huge effort where archaeological methods have been applied to recover fixes and improvements developed independently over several decades by the following projects: Heimdal, Festival speech-tools, Debian, as well as patches by Mr. Steve Tell.</description>

      <title>Minix editline moves to GIT</title>

      <description>A small heads-up, I&amp;rsquo;ve migrated the Minix editline project from Bazaar to GIT. The new URL for keeping tabs on your favourite free readline() clone is:
 http://git.vmlinux.org/editline.git/
 I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on fixing up the tree and doing some house cleaning &amp;mdash; including making more stuff configurable &amp;mdash; before releasing a 1.14.0 later on.
One such item is the integration of libtool with our autoconf friends. This should make it lot more portable (again) and also help smooth a merge with other sources for this library.</description>

      <description>For a while now I&amp;rsquo;ve been maintaining a port of the Minix editline library libedit. Mainly for my own purposes, or rather on behalf of Westermo WeOS, where it is used in the CLI. This library is the same as the Debian editline package, even though the origin of that package is somewhat unclear to me.
Today I decided to adjust the package name and bump the version number to indicate that my port is the same, and now slightly more advanced, than the Debian version.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s here! Fresh, new and packed with new features! Well, really just one new major feature â€” support for ANSI arrow keys. A good enough reason to bump the minor version number :-)

      <description>Oups, it seems I forgot to announce the v0.2.2 release of the Minix editline library! It was made official in Bazaar over a month ago, 2008-10-02, but it was not until today that the tarball was created and uploaded to the FTP.
The most noteworthy in this release is support for command completion with the addition of rl_complete() and rl_list_possib(). Two function pointers that easily can be overloaded by the user.</description>

      <description>The v0.2.0 release included some Debian patches, tcgetattr() and a batch mode (when reading from file) line reader. This release fixes a bug in the Debian patch that caused the batch mode version of readline() to actually truncate lines longer than 64 chars.

      <description>Another day another release, I guess. :-)
Lots of small fixes &amp;mdash; it can now be cross-built for Arm (Xscale) without any serious warnings. Get it from the usual FTP location:

      <description>Hot on the heels of the first one, only minor build fixes but this one should actually be usable by others. Now installs both library, include file and man page into the given --prefix.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking long and hard for a small and useful GNU readline replacement. Oddly enough, all the time I was looking for one I never even once considered looking at the Minix sources!
Currently I&amp;rsquo;m using the NetBSD editline derivative (readline compatible) from Jess Thrysoee, but it requires ncurses, which is huge!
All I really wanted was a bare bones readline() suitable for small embedded systems. One which could record history and preferably, but not required to, support completion.</description>
