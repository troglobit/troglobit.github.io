<h3 id="changes">Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add support for built-in inetd super server &ndash; launch services on
demand.  Supports filtering per interface and custom Inet ports.</li>
<li>Upgrade to <a href="https://github.com/troglobit/libuev">libuEv</a> v1.1.0 to better handle error conditions.</li>
<li>Allow mixed case config directives in <code>finit.conf</code></li>
<li>Add support for RFC 868 (rdate) time plugin, start as inetd service.</li>
<li>Load plugins before parsing <code>finit.conf</code>, this makes it possible to
extend finit even with configuration commands.  E.g., the <code>time.so</code>
plugin must be loaded for the <code>inetd time/tcp internal</code> service to be
accepted when parsing <code>finit.conf</code>.</li>
<li>Slight change in TTY fallback behavior, if no TTY is listed in the
system <code>finit.conf</code> first inspect the <code>console</code> setting and only if
that too is unset fall back to <code>/bin/sh</code></li>
<li>When falling back to the <code>console</code> TTY or <code>/bin/sh</code>, finit now marks
this fallback as console.  Should improve usability in some use cases.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Revert &ldquo;Use vfork() instead of fork() before exec()&rdquo; from v1.11.  It
turned out to not work so well after all.  For instance, launching
TTYs in a background process completely blocked inetd services from
even starting up listening sockets &hellip; proper fork seems to work fine
though.  This is the casue for <em>yanking</em> the <a href="https://github.com/troglobit/finit/compare/1.10...1.11">1.11</a> release.</li>
<li>Trap segfaults caused by external plugins/callbacks in a sub-process.
This prevents a single programming mistake in by a 3rd party developer
from taking down the entire system.</li>
<li>Fix Coverity CID 56281: <code>dlopen()</code> resource leak by storing the
pointer.  For the time being we do not support unloading plugins.</li>
<li>Set hostname early, so bootstrap processes like syslog can use it.</li>
<li>Only restart <em>lost daemons</em> when recovering from a <code>SIGSTOP</code>/norespawn.</li>
</ul>
