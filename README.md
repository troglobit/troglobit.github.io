Hello and welcome to my blog, or rather the Jekyll sources for my blog
at http://troglobit.com

The theme is based on [Freshman21](http://yulijia.net/freshman21/),
which is a a tribute to WordPress Theme Twenty-Twelve and Twenty-eleven.

Enjoy.

Custom Domain
-------------

To set up a custom domain for your blog at GitHub Pages:

1. Add a file `CNAME` to your blog repo with the contents your custom
   domain.  In my case this was `troglobit.com`
2. At your DNS provider, set up an A record for your domain to point to
   the GitHub Pages IP# 192.30.252.153
3. I also clicked the checkbox "Synchronize domain name and www." at my provider
