    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many years ago now I was looking for a faster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init">init</a> for <a href="http://westermo.com/">work</a>.
I found <a href="http://helllabs.org/finit/">Finit</a> and since then I&rsquo;ve been working on improving upon
it.  <a href="https://github.com/troglobit/finit">My version of Finit</a> is available on GitHub.</p>

<p>Finit was initially written by <a href="https://github.com/cmatsuoka">Claudio Matsuoka</a> to act as a drop-in
replacement for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_PC">Asus EeePC</a> <a href="http://wiki.eeeuser.com/boot_process:the_boot_process">fastinit</a>, &ldquo;gaps filled with
frog DNA&rdquo; &hellip;  Until I found Finit I had always been in awe of people
venturing into the realm of <a href="http://0pointer.net/blog/">PID 1</a>, but learning from the simplicity
of Claudio&rsquo;s code I slowly began understanding what it was all about.</p>

<p>Finit is open sourced under the very liberal <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT/X11 license</a>.
Much of the code has proven extremely useful to me in other projects
over the years.  It takes a while to realize, but there are actually a
lot of APIs missing in the C library and Finit has helped me bridge that
gap in a lot of projects.</p>

<p>Recently I broke out the most generic pieces from Finit into a separate
library, which I call <a href="https://github.com/troglobit/libite">libite</a>, (because it looks fun when linking
with it: <code>-lite</code>), and complemented it with a few pieces of my own and
some from the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> project, most notably their famous string
functions: <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=strlcpy">strlcpy(3)</a> and <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=strlcpy">strlcat(3)</a>.  It also holds the
very useful *BSD linked list API <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man3/LIST_EMPTY.3">sys/queue.h</a>, which is a much more
up to date version than GLIBC carries!  GLIBC does not have the <code>_SAFE</code>
macros for traversing lists while deleting/freeing nodes.</p>

<p>To make use of <code>-lite</code> and its APIs you can add <code>libite</code> as a GIT
submodule to your project:</p>

<pre><code>git submodule add https://github.com/troglobit/libite.git
</code></pre>

<p>You then need to add <code>#include "libite/lite.h"</code> to the source and adapt
your Makefile slightly to call the <code>libite/Makefile</code> before linking the
static <code>.a</code> library:</p>

<pre><code>all: $(EXEC) libite/libite.a

libite/libite.a: Makefile
        @$(MAKE) STATIC=1 -C libite

$(EXEC): $(OBJS) libite/libite.a
        @gcc -o $@ $^
</code></pre>

<p>For an example of how this can look, see my project <a href="https://github.com/troglobit/uftpd">uftpd</a>, which
uses both <code>-lite</code> and <code>-luev</code>.  The latter is my small event library,
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/libuev">libuEv</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2015/07/01/howto-push-to-multiple-git-repos-with-one-command/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-01T00:42:17+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2015/07/01/howto-push-to-multiple-git-repos-with-one-command</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, now that I have <a href="http://git.troglobit.com">http://git.troglobit.com</a> setup as a backup GIT repo
to <a href="https://github.com/troglobit,">https://github.com/troglobit,</a> I needed a <em>simple</em> way of always
pushing to both repos &ndash; best way for me is to always hook into my
regular work flow, otherwise I&rsquo;d just forget.  The <a href="1">git-remote(1)</a>
man page describes the new <code>set-url --add</code> sub-command:</p>

<pre><code>git remote set-url --add origin troglobit.com:/srv/git/watchdogd.git
</code></pre>

<p>Now, with a simple <code>git push</code> followed by <code>git push --tags</code> I had now
pushed to both the GitHub repo as well as my own server!</p>

<p>Of course I first had to create the empty <code>watchdogd.git</code> on the server:</p>

<pre><code>cd /srv/git
git init --bare watchdogd.git
echo "Refurbished watchdog daemon from uClinux-dist" &gt;watchdogd.git/description
</code></pre>

<p>To inspect your current push/pull repos, issue <code>git remote -v</code>:</p>

<pre><code>origin  git@github.com:troglobit/watchdogd.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:troglobit/watchdogd.git (push)
origin  troglobit.com:/srv/git/watchdogd.git (push)

    <link href="http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2015/06/30/howto-apache-with-gitweb-on-debian-8-dot-1/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-30T23:13:48+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2015/06/30/howto-apache-with-gitweb-on-debian-8-dot-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m posting this in case anyone else gets stuck setting up <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a>
with <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/gitweb">Gitweb</a>.  Also as a reminder to myself in case I ever need to
set up this all over again.</p>

<ol>
<li>You have all your eggs in one basket (GitHub), and</li>
<li>You really like that shiny basket, but</li>
<li>You know you&rsquo;re clumsy and usually drop baskets yourself.</li>
<li>You are wise (yes you are!) and realize you need another basket, so</li>
<li>You set up a server and a domain yourself &hellip;</li>
</ol>


<p>OK.  Let&rsquo;s start simple, since you are already running the latest Debian
you fire up the command line and install the basics:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install gitweb apache2
</code></pre>

<p>So it&rsquo;ll complain, you&rsquo;ll clarify your request and soon all required
packages are on your server.  Now what?</p>

<p>Debian has already set up <a href="http://localhost/gitweb">http://localhost/gitweb</a> for you, and if you
have a domain already you should go ahead and edit the master file for
that:</p>

<pre><code>editor /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
service apache2 reload
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to use that for your gitweb needs, then you&rsquo;re done!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>For me, running <a href="http://troglobit.com/gitweb">http://troglobit.com/gitweb</a> out of the box was not
enough.  I wanted to setup <a href="http://git.troglobit.com">http://git.troglobit.com</a> and also to make
sure to keep really short and pretty URLs to projects I host.  So the
next part of this post is about how to set that up.</p>

<p>My <code>000-default.conf</code> is for <a href="http://troglobit.com,">http://troglobit.com,</a> so I created a new
one for the sub-domain:</p>

<pre><code>editor /etc/apache2/sites-available/git.conf
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip; and added the following:</p>

<p>Remember to enable the new sub-domain in Apache and restart the daemon:</p>

<pre><code>a2ensite git
service apache2 restart
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m not using the default Debian GIT repo location, <code>/var/lib/git</code>, so I
need to set the project root for both the Apache and the GitWeb config:</p>

<p>The impossibly simple Apache config has been ripped from the intro by
<a href="http://dereenigne.org/debian/debian-gitweb-server">Jonathan McCrohan</a>,
the GitWeb config is a mixture of findings on the Internets.  Notice the
breadcrumbs and the grouping settings, very useful.</p>

<p>The magic with the pretty URLs is in both files, all <code>RewriteRule</code> lines
in the Apache <code>.conf</code> and the <code>$feature{'pathinfo'}{'default'} = [1];</code>
setting in <code>gitweb.conf</code>.</p>

<p>Also, try out the cool <a href="https://github.com/kogakure/gitweb-theme">theme</a>
I use, it looks a lot better than the default.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

    <link href="http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2015/03/06/inetd-support-in-finit-v1-dot-12/"/>
    <updated>2015-03-06T22:34:45+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2015/03/06/inetd-support-in-finit-v1-dot-12</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A steady flow of features, and releases, is key to keeping any project
alive.  Recently I ticked off another item in the <a href="http://troglobit.github.io/finit.html">Finit</a>
TODO list &hellip;</p>

<p>Finit v1.12 now comes with a built-in inetd!  You no longer need an
external inetd daemon to launch services on demand.</p>

<p>The good news doesn&rsquo;t stop there, this little inetd actually supports a
poor man&rsquo;s tcpwrappers!</p>

<pre><code>inetd ssh/tcp          nowait [2345] /sbin/dropbear -i -R -F
inetd ssh@eth0:222/tcp nowait [2345] /sbin/dropbear -i -R -F
</code></pre>

<p>With these two lines in your <code>/etc/finit.conf</code> you tell finit to launch
the <a href="https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html">Dropbear SSH</a>
server on demand on port 22 (default ssh/tcp port in <code>/etc/services</code>) on
<em>all</em> interfaces except on <code>eth0</code>, which in your case is the Internet
(WAN) interface, here you want SSH to run on port 222.  Actually, you
don&rsquo;t want port 22 open at all on <code>eth0</code> &hellip; so finit takes care of this
for you!  Seriously, it just works, no need for messing about with that
nasty old <code>iptables</code> anymore!</p>

<p>The original UNIX inetd super server supported many protocols
internally, some of which may seem a bit odd today, and some have been
superseded by more modern protocols.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_Protocol">echo</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_Generator_Protocol">chargen</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Protocol">time</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_Protocol">daytime</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discard_Protocol">discard</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Finit currently only supports one internal/built-in standard service,
<code>time</code>.  It is built as a plugin to serve as an example of how you can
extend Finit yourself.  The time service can be called either as UDP or
TCP.  To prevent security issues, the <code>time</code> protocol is disabled by
default.  To enable it you need two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>time.so</code> plugin (built by default)</li>
<li>An <code>inetd time ...</code> line in <code>/etc/finit.conf</code></li>
</ol>


<p>Assuming you&rsquo;ve installed the default set of plugins, the following two
lines can be added:</p>

<pre><code>inetd time/udp   wait [2345] internal
inetd time/tcp nowait [2345] internal
</code></pre>

<p>This can be very useful for testing the inetd capabilities, your network
connection, or simply to get the time to a client where NTP for some
reason does not work, or is blocked.  For instance, you could have a GPS
setup on your server and distribute time to clients with the <code>time</code>
protocol.</p>

<p>To use it you need an <a href="http://www.aelius.com/njh/rdate/"><code>rdate</code></a>
client.  Users of <code>rdate</code> in BusyBox may need to be reminded that it
only supports TCP.</p>

<pre><code>$ rdate -pu 198.51.100.42
Sat Mar  7 08:48:58 CET 2015
</code></pre>

<p>For more info on Finit and its features, see the <a href="https://github.com/troglobit/finit/blob/master/README.md">README</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy! ツ</p>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Add support for built-in inetd super server &ndash; launch services on
demand.  Supports filtering per interface and custom Inet ports.</li>
<li>Upgrade to <a href="https://github.com/troglobit/libuev">libuEv</a> v1.1.0 to better handle error conditions.</li>
<li>Allow mixed case config directives in <code>finit.conf</code></li>
<li>Add support for RFC 868 (rdate) time plugin, start as inetd service.</li>
<li>Load plugins before parsing <code>finit.conf</code>, this makes it possible to
extend finit even with configuration commands.  E.g., the <code>time.so</code>
plugin must be loaded for the <code>inetd time/tcp internal</code> service to be
accepted when parsing <code>finit.conf</code>.</li>
<li>Slight change in TTY fallback behavior, if no TTY is listed in the
system <code>finit.conf</code> first inspect the <code>console</code> setting and only if
that too is unset fall back to <code>/bin/sh</code></li>
<li>When falling back to the <code>console</code> TTY or <code>/bin/sh</code>, finit now marks
this fallback as console.  Should improve usability in some use cases.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Revert &ldquo;Use vfork() instead of fork() before exec()&rdquo; from v1.11.  It
turned out to not work so well after all.  For instance, launching
TTYs in a background process completely blocked inetd services from
even starting up listening sockets &hellip; proper fork seems to work fine
though.  This is the casue for <em>yanking</em> the <a href="https://github.com/troglobit/finit/compare/1.10...1.11">1.11</a> release.</li>
<li>Trap segfaults caused by external plugins/callbacks in a sub-process.
This prevents a single programming mistake in by a 3rd party developer
from taking down the entire system.</li>
<li>Fix Coverity CID 56281: <code>dlopen()</code> resource leak by storing the
pointer.  For the time being we do not support unloading plugins.</li>
<li>Set hostname early, so bootstrap processes like syslog can use it.</li>
<li>Only restart <em>lost daemons</em> when recovering from a <code>SIGSTOP</code>/norespawn.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2015/01/24/finit-v1-dot-11-released/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-24T16:54:23+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2015/01/24/finit-v1-dot-11-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update 2015-03-09</strong>: This release has unfortunately been <em>yanked</em> due
to serious regressions in launching background processes.  It has been
replaced by <a href="http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2015/03/06/inetd-support-in-finit-v1-dot-12/">v1.12</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very pleased to announce <a href="http://troglobit.github.io/finit.html">Finit v1.11</a> — this is the
episode where two of my projects finally get married! ツ</p>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Now using the asynchronous <a href="https://github.com/troglobit/libuev">libuEv</a> library for handling all events:
signals, timers and listening to sockets or file descriptors.</li>
<li>Rename NEWS.md &ndash;> CHANGELOG.md, with symlinks for <code>make install</code></li>
<li>Attempt to align with <a href="http://keepachangelog.com">http://keepachangelog.com</a> for the ChangeLog</li>
<li><a href="https://travis-ci.org/troglobit/finit">Travis CI</a> now only invokes <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3545">Coverity Scan</a> from the &lsquo;dev&rsquo; branch.  This
means that all development, except documentation updates, must go into
that branch.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fix bug with finit dying when no <code>tty</code> is defined in <code>finit.conf</code>, now
even the fallback shell has control over its TTY, see fix in GIT
commit <a href="https://github.com/troglobit/finit/commit/dea3ae8">dea3ae8</a> for this.</li>

    <link href="http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2015/01/12/rant-all-the-c-compiler-warnings-dot-dot-dot/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-12T01:57:40+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2015/01/12/rant-all-the-c-compiler-warnings-dot-dot-dot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Enable <em>all</em> the warnings!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>This is one of the truths you learn when you start working with C.  Most
of the time adding <code>CPPFLAGS="-W -Wall -Werror"</code> is all you need to find
all the nasty bugs.  And if that&rsquo;s not enough, there are tons of tools
for static code analysis, like <code>scan-build</code> in
<a href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/scan-build.html">Clang</a>, and
<a href="https://scan.coverity.com/">Coverity Scan</a>, to help you <em>find all the
bugs</em>!</p>

<p>However, these pesky warnings (some of which cannot even be disabled!)
are sometimes more of a nuisance than help.  Sometimes you <em>know</em> that
some parameters to a function will remain unused &ndash; it&rsquo;s a callback, and
you don&rsquo;t need all the data given to you.  So you start adding all kinds
of voodoo, like <code>__attribite__ ((unused))</code> &hellip; seriously?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Imagine this now sprinkled all over the code base.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='C'><span class='line'><span class="k">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">callback</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">uev_ctx_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">ctx</span> <span class="n">__attribute__</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="n">unused</span><span class="p">)),</span>
</span><span class='line'>                     <span class="kt">uev_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">w</span> <span class="n">__attribute__</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="n">unused</span><span class="p">)),</span>
</span><span class='line'>                     <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">arg</span> <span class="n">__attribute__</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="n">unused</span><span class="p">)),</span>

</span><span class='line'>        <span class="p">...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So you make small macros to help out:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='C'><span class='line'><span class="cp">#define UNUSED(arg) arg __attribite__ ((unused))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We now have this instead:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='C'><span class='line'><span class="k">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">callback</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">uev_ctx_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">UNUSED</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ctx</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="kt">uev_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">UNUSED</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>                     <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">UNUSED</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">UNUSED</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">events</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="p">...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Admittedly, using the macro is much cleaner, but still.  Why not just
allow this <em>much more readable</em> version?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='C'><span class='line'><span class="k">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">callback</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">uev_ctx_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">ctx</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">uev_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">arg</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">events</span><span class="p">)</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The human eye is marvellous at finding little things that stick out,
but when there&rsquo;s nothing but annoying things on the screen we can no
longer see the most obvious pointer casting bugs, and we get sloppy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m seriously considering adding some kind of <code>--developer-mode</code> to my
own projects which will warn like crazy, as usual, and as soon as I turn
it off (default) complete silence will arrive.  That&rsquo;s how sick and
tired I am of <em>all the warnings</em> and the resulting almost completely
unreadable code.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m a coder, not a writer.  Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been working on during the
winter holidays:</p>

<ul>
<li>A new feature release of <a href="http://troglobit.github.io/finit.html">Finit</a> is coming shortly, which
will use <a href="https://github.com/troglobit/libuev">libuEv</a> and feature
inetd support built-in!</li>
<li>Another minor release of my own take on event loops,
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/libuev">libuEv</a>
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/libuev/releases/tag/v1.0.3">v1.0.3</a>.
This time with a heavy focus on documentation and Q&amp;A, extensive
validation testing have been done on this release.</li>
<li>Released another minor release of <a href="http://troglobit.github.io/mrouted.html">mrouted</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/mrouted/releases/tag/3.9.7">v3.9.7</a>,
which despite its age, and all other obvious limitations of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_Vector_Multicast_Routing_Protocol">DVMRP</a>,
is still one of the best options for <em>dynamic</em> multicast routing
available today.</li>
<li><p>Major new release of <a href="http://troglobit.github.io/pimd.html">pimd</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/pimd/releases/tag/2.2.0">v2.2.0</a>, which
is likely the last release ever of the old pimd, unless someone starts
paying me to work on it.</p>

<p>&hellip; or more people step up to help.  Both the Xorp PIM-SM and the
upcoming Quagga PIM-SSM implementations are in better shape.  The only
thing old pimd has got going for it is the license.  It&rsquo;s 3-clause
BSD, so very liberal.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in pitching in, on any of my projects, just send me
an email or connect with me on GitHub!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve had this long-standing issue with backups.  It&rsquo;s deadly boring to
set up and maintain, so I don&rsquo;t do any.  Until today!</p>

<p>Today I moved the sources for my <a href="http://troglobit.com">Octopress blag</a>
to GitHub, which also prompted me to set up
<a href="http://troglobit.github.io">a mirror</a> on
<a href="http://pages.github.io">GitHub Pages</a>.  As usual, reading up on the
subject and muster enough motivation took me about three months, whereas
the actual work took about 4h.</p>

<p>I now have a concoction of mixed remotes, multiple branches and some
Ruby magic to administer it all with!  Here are some links I used to
get where I am:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">http://octopress.org/docs/setup/</a></li>

<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/</a></li>
</ul>


<p>With some added <code>apt-get intall ruby ruby-bundler</code> magic in Ubuntu
everything started to look normal &ndash; now I could even do <code>rake preview</code>
before deploying!  Only a minor problem I had before getting everything
working was this:</p>

<blockquote><p>/usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.2/gems/execjs-2.2.0/lib/execjs/runtimes.rb:51:in `autodetect&#8217;:
Could not find a JavaScript runtime. See <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs">https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs</a>
for a list of available runtimes. (ExecJS::RuntimeUnavailable)</p></blockquote>

<p>Turns out I had to install nodejs as well, dunno why.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install nodejs
</code></pre>

<p>Since I wanted a mirrored setup I chose to have Octopress setup default
to deploy to GitHub Pages.  Then I simply rsync the whole shebang to my
own server.</p>

<p>All this means I can now finally begin restoring more content from
<a href="http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2013/02/17/resurrection/">my old blog</a> thanks to partial backups
I&rsquo;ve found at the <a href="https://archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> :-)</p>

    <id>http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2014/12/28/mrouted-v3-dot-9-7</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another release today is the venerable <a href="http://troglobit.github.io/mrouted.html">mrouted</a>, now
available as
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/mrouted/releases/tag/3.9.7">v3.9.7 on GitHub</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Changes &amp; New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>SNMP Support removed.  It never compiled and would have likely
needed a complete refactor to support modern AgentX.</li>
<li>Replaced static <code>config.mk</code> with configure script from pimd</li>
<li>RSRR Support now disabled by default, use <code>--enable-rsrr</code> to configure
script to re-enable</li>
<li>Possible to start with <code>mrouted</code> disabled on all interfaces by
default.  Use <code>enable</code> to .conf <code>phyint</code> directive and <code>-M/-N</code> command
line options to control behavior, default is same as before.  Thanks
to Joseph Gooch (<a href="https://github.com/goochjj">@goochjj</a>) for this feature!</li>
<li>Add David Waitzman and Craig Partridge to list of original authors
of <code>mrouted</code>, after being by Mr Waitzman :)</li>
<li>Change to use <code>stdint.h</code> types instead of unsafe homegrown types</li>
</ul>


<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fix issue with older BSD kernels, mainly for current FreeBSD 10 and
older, that don&rsquo;t really give RAW sockets but byte swap <code>ip_len</code>
field, Olivier Cochard-Labbé (<a href="https://github.com/ocochard">@ocochard</a>)</li>
<li>Build fixes for FreeBSD, should make maintaining ports easier :)</li>
<li>Change from <code>select()</code> to <code>poll()</code> due to descriptor limits, e.g.,
on BSD.</li>
<li>UNIX 2038 first audit, inspired by OpenBSD.  Cleanup type confusion
<code>int/u_long</code> where it should be <code>time_t</code>.  Also, clarify that <code>genid</code>
is OK, since it&rsquo;s used and stored as unsigned 32-bit integer.</li>
<li>Lots of minor fixes detected by Coverity Scan and Clang scan-build
<a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3320">https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3320</a></li>

    <id>http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2014/12/28/last-release-of-pimd</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On one of the last days of 2014 I release <a href="http://troglobit.github.io/pimd.html">pimd</a>
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/pimd/releases/tag/2.2.0">v2.2.0</a>, which
is an awesome release with a lot of new features and bug fixes!</p>

<p>However, it could very well be the last release I do.  Even though its
one of my most popular projects on
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit">GitHub</a> I have not had enough time to
dedicate to it over the years.  I will continue to do fixes and merge
pull requests until someone else steps up to take over.  There is also
the distinct possibility that the
<a href="https://github.com/greearb/xorp.ct">Xorp PIM-SM</a> or the new
<a href="https://github.com/udhos/qpimd">Quagga PIM-SSM</a> implementations will
(finally) make good old pimd completely redundant.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.westermo.com">work</a> we will likely start using the
Quagga PIM rather than pimd in WeOS.</p>

<p>For now though, enjoy pimd v2.2.0.  It&rsquo;s been tested in both my Qemu
based virtual testbed and a few setups using Linux&#8217; <code>netns</code> feature in
<a href="http://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/ncs/products/core">CORE</a> &ndash; awesome
little proggy! :-)</p>

hopefully this will get into Debian &hellip; unless the Jessie freeze

<p>Also, thanks to a friend of mine trying out <a href="http://troglobit.github.io/uftpd.html">uftpd</a>
recently I discovered that libuev has been missing from the tarball
since the release of the TFTP support.  Fixed.</p>

<p>Another great piece of news is that

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today sees the release of v1.3 of the awesome little uftpd. The main
news is the new TFTP support!  Just like before you don&rsquo;t need any
configuration file, just build and install &ndash; or build a .deb file and
install.</p>

<p>This release completes the main purpose of uftpd for me, I can now use
it as my daily driver and fully replace vsftpd and tftpd-hpa, which to
me are the next best.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s left then, you ask?  Well, TFTP upload support, TFTP segment
size negotiation and possibly multiple user support in FTP.  As
always, patches are most welcome.  See the
<a href="http://troglobit.github.io/uftpd.html">uftpd homepage</a> and my

corporate software and it&rsquo;s nowhere near as done and ready as project
management thinks.  Of course you&rsquo;ve already started chugging away at
it, fixing bugs, refactoring code and wrapping it in neat containers
to keep the changeset against the base SW small &ndash; you already know
you&rsquo;ll get another drop of the same stinking pieace of code in another
six months, so you keep the changes small and track them in GIT with
neatly formatted commit messages.</p>

<p>About ten commits in it dawns on you that you have several commits
that would need to be squashed and some commit messages that needs to
be edited &hellip; you start typing in <code>git rebase -i origin/...</code> wait, you
haven&rsquo;t pushed anything yet.  So how do you rebase something that&rsquo;s

    <updated>2014-06-29T14:52:39+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2014/06/29/on-the-demise-of-free-code-dot-dot-dot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I feel I have to write something about the demise of
<a href="http://freecode.com">free(code)</a>.
<a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5936">Others</a> have written about it too,
and its been covered on <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/603403/">lwn.net</a> as
well.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually a rather depressing development.  They claim it&rsquo;s due to
the low traffic and decline in updates, but it&rsquo;s evident that&rsquo;s not
the whole truth.  The owners recommend their other site, SourceForge,
but anyone having been in the loop for the last decade or two knows
that SourceForge has been in a slow decline for a long time, more so
than free(code) in my opinion.  Also, SourceForge only lists its own
projects, and only the most active or &ldquo;top&rdquo; projects.</p>

<p>I never used free(code) to find the &ldquo;top&rdquo; projects or the most active
ones.  That&rsquo;s completely useless to me.  I went there to dig for small
unknown projects, small gems that are usually unlisted on GitHub or
SourceForge.  I went there to publicize my own small creations, learn
about other similar projects and get a quick feedback on recent
changes of new releases to projects I was interested in.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There exist no real replacement to free(code), except perhaps for
<a href="https://www.openhub.net/">Open Hub</a>, previously known as
<a href="http://www.ohloh.net">Ohloh</a>.  The
<a href="http://directory.fsf.org">Free Software Directory</a> could perhaps have
become something over time, but unfortunately feels like yet another
<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">Cathedral Style</a>
project from the FSF.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love the FSF and almost
everything they do, but they often get lost in their old tradition of
big closed off idealistic projects.  Eric S. Raymond has
<a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5948">a proposal</a> for replacing free(code)
and he is that sort of pragmatic person that could get something off
the ground.  In any case it&rsquo;ll be interesting, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

<p>Some people say all the action is on GitHub these days, but that&rsquo;s
just like an echo of the glory days of CVS, Subversion and the start
of the new millenia when we should all use SourceForge.  Been there,
done that, and yes I do use GitHub, but again it doesn&rsquo;t list anything
but GitHub projects &hellip;</p>

<p>Other people say that to promote your small projects you need to
become active in a Linux distro, or write about them in magazines or
on <a href="http://hackerne.ws">Hacker News</a> &hellip; well, I&rsquo;d like very much to
become a Debian developer one day, but the process to become one seems
so increadibly daunting!  Also, I&rsquo;m not a writer, nor am I a native
English speaker, I&rsquo;m
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JustaProgrammer">just a programmer</a> and I
really miss free(code)!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t expect this blog to have any readers at all, so using it as
the sole platform for announcing new releases is rather pointless.  So
I&rsquo;ve started playing around with
<a href="https://www.openhub.net/accounts/troglobit">Open Hub</a> for my own most
relevant projects.  It has some nice stats and other useful features
that I can use.  Hopefully it can serve as a replacement for my most
basic needs.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last couple of weeks have both seen the birth of the fabulous
<a href="http://troglobit.github.io/uftpd.html">uftpd</a> and a reignited <a href="http://troglobit.github.io/inadyn.html">inadyn</a> project!
Yesterday v1.2 of uftpd was released and today Inadyn saw the first
working HTTPS support being released as v1.99.8!  This is likely the
last release of Inadyn before the big 2.0, which will introduce the
new .conf file format based on
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/">libConfuse</a>.  A .conf file
feasibility study was
<a href="http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2014/02/23/weekend-hack-json-vs-conf/">presented earlier</a> &hellip;</p>

<p>The uftpd project is completely based on user input, currently mostly
mine.  I will add features and bug fixes when I need them, unless I
get more input.  So I welcome anyone to clone it on GitHub and hack
away.  As usual, I will accept any sane patches that adhere to the
coding style and is well written.  The same goes for Inadyn, only with
the added request that the changes are thoroughly tested first, since
I cannot maintain multiple accounts on various DDNS providers myself.</p>

<p>Patches to support flavors of UNIX other than GNU/Linux, including
GNU/Hurd, or even other operating systems are also welcome, as long as
it&rsquo;s not Windows.  I will not maintain any Windows support since I
don&rsquo;t use it myself.  If you want Windows support you will have to
take a very active co-maintainer role in the respective project.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Looking for a Dynamic DNS, DDNS, client?  Well you&rsquo;re in luck, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_free_software" title="FLOSS">FLOSS</a> market space is flooded with dedicated clients and various
wget scripts.  So why bother with an old C implementation?  Well, this
is admittedly one of the old timers in the game and is likely packaged
for your GNU/Linux distribution of choice already.  It&rsquo;s tried and
tested with many DDNS service providers and even comes bundled in a
few embedded router distributions as well.</p>

<p>Today I&rsquo;ve released <a href="http://troglobit.github.io/inadyn.html">Inadyn</a> v1.99.7 as an XZ compressed
tarball.  The release announcement should be up on <a href="https://freecode.com/projects/inadyn">free(code)</a>
now.  It&rsquo;s a small incremental release containing mainly code cleanup
and a few new features that you likely won&rsquo;t notice: support for
multiple cache files and DDNS providers as separate plugins, for easy
addition of new ones as well as maintenance of existing.  This further
separates the internal logic from the provider specific parts and also
helps reduce clutter to ease maintenance.</p>

<p>This is a small incremental release building up to the long awaited
v2.0, which will include the long-awaited HTTPS support and also a new
.conf file format.  The latter is not really welcomed with open arms
by users, but is a necessary step since the current parser is heavily
affected by bit rot and must be put down.  I will attempt to make the
transition as easy as possible, but you will need to change you .conf
files.</p>

<p>Maybe a preview of the HTTPS support will make it into a release that
still has the old .conf file format, but just maybe.</p>

    <updated>2014-05-04T11:25:09+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2014/05/04/why-write-your-own-ftp-server</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, I finally got fed up with all other FTP servers and wrote
<a href="http://troglobit.github.io/uftpd.html">my own</a>.  Why would someone in their right mind do
something like this 2014?</p>

<p>As a developer the answer to most such questions is usually; to
scratch an itch.  For a very long time I&rsquo;ve looked for a really simple
FTP server that just works, out of the box!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>My alternatives on GNU/Linux distributions have been: several variants
of the original <a href="https://github.com/mit-athena/ftpd">MIT/Athena ftpd</a>,
<a href="http://www.proftpd.org/">ProFTPD</a>,
<a href="http://www.pureftpd.org/project/pure-ftpd">Pure-FTPd</a>, and
<a href="https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html">vstfptd</a>.  Most of them are
too damn difficult to configure, have ugly configuration files or are
plainly just too confusing.  With one exception, vsftpd.  I really
like vsftpd!  It&rsquo;s got a simple and well documented configuration file
(inline as comments) and always worked almost painlessly for me.</p>

<p>However, over the past couple of Ubuntu LTS installations it&rsquo;s been
starting to act up on me.  Not allowing me to have a group-writable
root directory, and not even an ability to disable that security
feature.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s simple really.  I&rsquo;m a developer.  I have colleagues.  We share
servers at work.  We bootstrap and upgrade our embedded devices using
TFTP/FTP.  We have one directory, usually <code>/srv/ftp</code>, which is group
writable and all developers are members of that group.  Anyone can
upload a file there and the file servers &hellip; would you know &hellip; are
supposed to <em>serve</em> that file, as TFTP or anonymous FTP.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m a fringe user?  Maybe secured local area networks, or laptop
to embedded device crossed-cables networks, are no longer the &ldquo;fad&rdquo;?
Maybe a sane built-in default is no longer cool or hipster enough?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know anymore, and this time I was so fed up chasing around for
answers to &ldquo;How to setup your &lsquo;favorite&rsquo; FTP Server&rdquo;, that I just sat
down and fixed it once and for all.  I figured I&rsquo;d otherwise be doing
this waltz over and over again, just like I already have, for the next
10 years &hellip;</p>

<p>I trawled the net once more for good candidates, this time for
adoption and holy cow sacrifices.  I wanted a very simple base to
start from, which I could cut up into pieces, iteratively refactor and
improve upon until I was happy.  That took a while.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of both the Free Software and the Open Source cultures.
(They are slightly different you know.)  I routinely work on software
with GNU GPL, MIT/X11, Apache, and ISC licenses, but for most of my
own creations I usually lean towards the very permissive
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license">ISC license</a>.  Maybe
because most of my hobby work these days are quick and dirty hacks I
don&rsquo;t really care enough about.  It&rsquo;s a question of both taste and
appropriateness &ndash; like software patents, I don&rsquo;t like them either,
but for anything which I have a great investment in, or has a great
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_originality">threshold of originality</a>,
I&rsquo;d use a more restrictive license to make sure the software is kept
in the open.</p>

<p>Anyway, I read much code, discarded several projects that were too
big, too unreadable code or simply didn&rsquo;t feel right.  I tested so
many small &ldquo;FTP&rdquo; servers that turned out to be unusable homegrown
variants or school projects.  There&rsquo;s a lot of code out there &hellip;  I
finally settled on <a href="https://github.com/xu-wang11/FtpServer">FtpServer</a>
by <a href="https://github.com/xu-wang11">Xu Wang</a> as a base for my little
project.  I suspect it too is a school project, but this one actually
worked, right off the bat!</p>

<p>I got so excited that I immediately started improving it, cleaning up
the source code, reindenting it (KNF) and fixing small bugs here and
there.  It was a perfect fit!  This is where I made my big mistake,
which I hope will not eventually kill this project in the end &ndash; the
FtpServer project did not have a license &hellip; so
<a href="https://github.com/xu-wang11/FtpServer/issues/1">I filed a bug</a> to
the GitHub issue tracker, added the ISC license to
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/uftpd">my fork</a> and continued hacking
away.  The changes I&rsquo;ve made are so substantial that there isn&rsquo;t much
left of the original code, so uftpd should be safe.  Yes, I named it
uftpd, the micro ftp server &ndash; the no nonsense file transfer protocol
daemon.</p>

<p>The whole hack took about three days and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot during
this time!  It was fun, inspiring and gave me a lot of creative energy
that I can use in other projects: at work as well as at home :)</p>
