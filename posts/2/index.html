  <div class="entry-content"><p>Looking for a Dynamic DNS, DDNS, client?  Well you&rsquo;re in luck, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_free_software" title="FLOSS">FLOSS</a> market space is flooded with dedicated clients and various
wget scripts.  So why bother with an old C implementation?  Well, this
is admittedly one of the old timers in the game and is likely packaged
for your GNU/Linux distribution of choice already.  It&rsquo;s tried and
tested with many DDNS service providers and even comes bundled in a
few embedded router distributions as well.</p>

<p>Today I&rsquo;ve released <a href="/inadyn.html">Inadyn</a> v1.99.7 as an XZ compressed
tarball.  The release announcement should be up on <a href="https://freecode.com/projects/inadyn">free(code)</a>
now.  It&rsquo;s a small incremental release containing mainly code cleanup
and a few new features that you likely won&rsquo;t notice: support for
multiple cache files and DDNS providers as separate plugins, for easy
addition of new ones as well as maintenance of existing.  This further
separates the internal logic from the provider specific parts and also
helps reduce clutter to ease maintenance.</p>

<p>This is a small incremental release building up to the long awaited
v2.0, which will include the long-awaited HTTPS support and also a new
.conf file format.  The latter is not really welcomed with open arms
by users, but is a necessary step since the current parser is heavily
affected by bit rot and must be put down.  I will attempt to make the
transition as easy as possible, but you will need to change you .conf
files.</p>

<p>Maybe a preview of the HTTPS support will make it into a release that
still has the old .conf file format, but just maybe.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I finally got fed up with all other FTP servers and wrote
<a href="/uftpd.html">my own</a>.  Why would someone in their right mind do
something like this 2014?</p>

<p>As a developer the answer to most such questions is usually; to
scratch an itch.  For a very long time I&rsquo;ve looked for a really simple
FTP server that just works, out of the box!</p>

<p>My alternatives on GNU/Linux distributions have been: several variants
of the original <a href="https://github.com/mit-athena/ftpd">MIT/Athena ftpd</a>,
<a href="http://www.proftpd.org/">ProFTPD</a>,
<a href="http://www.pureftpd.org/project/pure-ftpd">Pure-FTPd</a>, and
<a href="https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html">vstfptd</a>.  Most of them are
too damn difficult to configure, have ugly configuration files or are
plainly just too confusing.  With one exception, vsftpd.  I really
like vsftpd!  It&rsquo;s got a simple and well documented configuration file
(inline as comments) and always worked almost painlessly for me.</p>

<p>However, over the past couple of Ubuntu LTS installations it&rsquo;s been
starting to act up on me.  Not allowing me to have a group-writable
root directory, and not even an ability to disable that security
feature.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s simple really.  I&rsquo;m a developer.  I have colleagues.  We share
servers at work.  We bootstrap and upgrade our embedded devices using
TFTP/FTP.  We have one directory, usually <code>/srv/ftp</code>, which is group
writable and all developers are members of that group.  Anyone can
upload a file there and the file servers &hellip; would you know &hellip; are
supposed to <em>serve</em> that file, as TFTP or anonymous FTP.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m a fringe user?  Maybe secured local area networks, or laptop
to embedded device crossed-cables networks, are no longer the &ldquo;fad&rdquo;?
Maybe a sane built-in default is no longer cool or hipster enough?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know anymore, and this time I was so fed up chasing around for
answers to &ldquo;How to setup your &lsquo;favorite&rsquo; FTP Server&rdquo;, that I just sat
down and fixed it once and for all.  I figured I&rsquo;d otherwise be doing
this waltz over and over again, just like I already have, for the next
10 years &hellip;</p>

<p>I trawled the net once more for good candidates, this time for
adoption and holy cow sacrifices.  I wanted a very simple base to
start from, which I could cut up into pieces, iteratively refactor and
improve upon until I was happy.  That took a while.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of both the Free Software and the Open Source cultures.
(They are slightly different you know.)  I routinely work on software
with GNU GPL, MIT/X11, Apache, and ISC licenses, but for most of my
own creations I usually lean towards the very permissive
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license">ISC license</a>.  Maybe
because most of my hobby work these days are quick and dirty hacks I
don&rsquo;t really care enough about.  It&rsquo;s a question of both taste and
appropriateness &ndash; like software patents, I don&rsquo;t like them either,
but for anything which I have a great investment in, or has a great
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_originality">threshold of originality</a>,
I&rsquo;d use a more restrictive license to make sure the software is kept
in the open.</p>

<p>Anyway, I read much code, discarded several projects that were too
big, too unreadable code or simply didn&rsquo;t feel right.  I tested so
many small &ldquo;FTP&rdquo; servers that turned out to be unusable homegrown
variants or school projects.  There&rsquo;s a lot of code out there &hellip;  I
finally settled on <a href="https://github.com/xu-wang11/FtpServer">FtpServer</a>
by <a href="https://github.com/xu-wang11">Xu Wang</a> as a base for my little
project.  I suspect it too is a school project, but this one actually
worked, right off the bat!</p>

<p>I got so excited that I immediately started improving it, cleaning up
the source code, reindenting it (KNF) and fixing small bugs here and
there.  It was a perfect fit!  This is where I made my big mistake,
which I hope will not eventually kill this project in the end &ndash; the
FtpServer project did not have a license &hellip; so
<a href="https://github.com/xu-wang11/FtpServer/issues/1">I filed a bug</a> to
the GitHub issue tracker, added the ISC license to
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/uftpd">my fork</a> and continued hacking
away.  The changes I&rsquo;ve made are so substantial that there isn&rsquo;t much
left of the original code, so uftpd should be safe.  Yes, I named it
uftpd, the micro ftp server &ndash; the no nonsense file transfer protocol
daemon.</p>

<p>The whole hack took about three days and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot during
this time!  It was fun, inspiring and gave me a lot of creative energy
that I can use in other projects: at work as well as at home :)</p>

<p>See the <a href="/uftpd.html">uftpd project home</a> for download links.</p>

<a href="/finit.html">Finit</a> v1.9 :-)</p>

<p>Nothing fancy this time, just collecting some bug fixes, playing with
cppcheck a bit and adding support for including .conf files.  Quite
useful if you want to partition your configuration, or if you share
major pieces of configuration between different platforms.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>So, we finally got Google Music &amp; Movies services in Sweden!  The
prices seem a bit on the steep side, apart from maybe the Music
service, which is slightly cheaper than Spotify.  Will try it out for
a month or so to see which one I like better.</p>

<p>For some reason I chose Gravity as my first rental, at 39 Skr.  I&rsquo;ve
heard so many bad reviews of it but for better or worse it&rsquo;ll now be
my introduction to Google Movies :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was time.  I had been putting it off for far too long &ndash; learning
about JSON and deciding on a new .conf file format for
<a href="/inadyn.shtml">Inadyn</a>.  So this weekend I sat myself down to read up
on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> and the multitude of
parser libraries for both JSON and traditional .conf file parsers.  I
was looking for a human readable file format that a user could easily
and reliably edit by themselves without it being too error prone or
sensitive to mistyping.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/9177645.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;You are being &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gist/9177645&quot;&gt;redirected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>I quickly narrowed down my scope of investigation to
<a href="http://www.digip.org/jansson/">Jansson</a> for JSON and and
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/">Confuse</a> for &ldquo;standard&rdquo; UNIX .conf
files.  Both have very liberal licenses, extensive test suites, very
good documentation and are extremely well written!  In fact, I will
probably use them as prime examples of well maintained Open Source
projects in the future :-)</p>

<p>The resulting code is in my
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/toolbox/tree/master/conf">toolbox</a> on
GitHub.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/9177620.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;You are being &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gist/9177620&quot;&gt;redirected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>In my opinion the .conf file is a lot easier to read, write and edit
by Joe User, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll be using for many of my own projects,
starting with <a href="/inadyn.shtml">Inadyn</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes people ask me what I do for a living.  Usually I tend to
pause and think, real hard, becuase the people asking me this aren&rsquo;t
programmers.  They use computers, but are mostly limited to a Windows
machine, writing in MS Word and browsing the Internet, mostly for
Facebook.</p>

<p>I often start off with: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit complicated to explain &hellip; &rdquo;, by
which time I&rsquo;ve lost most of the people in the room listening to me.
Sometimes I say: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a software architect.&rdquo;, because people seem to
know what architects do for a living, they draw houses, design stuff
and drive SAAB&rsquo;s.  Much like dentists.  The prefix &ldquo;software&rdquo; however
does confuse people.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/programming-in-a-nutshell.gif"></p>

<p>In reality I&rsquo;m
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JustaProgrammer">just a programmer</a> with a
little bit more responsibility.  A day starts with coming in to the
office, or sitting down in my home office, connecting to the company
VPN, meanwhile planning loosely the day and my goals.  All while
checking status of e-mail, our IRC channel and the issue tracker for
any recently reported/updated issues in my fields of responsibility.
Somewhere around there I have a pretty good idea about what must be
done and in what order.  So I write it down, in no particular order,
on folded A4 sheets I use for TODO lists and start working.  About 20
minutes into that, when I&rsquo;ve just reached
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?InTheZone">The Zone</a>, I get interrupted for an
impromptu meeting, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call">telco</a>, which in turn
always leads to another meeting, which in turn runs over and suddenly
it&rsquo;s 16:00 (4 pm) and I have 45 minutes to complete a days work before
picking up the kids from school.</p>

<p>Or &hellip; you can apply that same crazy to a day when trying to fix a
simple bug, finding another horrbile bug and fixing that first,
leading to a minor redesign in need of a refactor, which in turn gives
me a pain to merge since during the time I tried fixing that minor bug
my collegues have done multiple changes to the same files I&rsquo;ve been
working on.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I do for a living.  And yes, I know it&rsquo;s not sustainable
work conditions.  I&rsquo;m working on that, it&rsquo;s on the TODO list &hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a rant about something I recently found to be a long standing
battle line in the world of programming,
<a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~mema/courses/mde518/papers/lauer78.pdf">Lau78</a>.
The event vs thread based approach to programming.  As rants go I do
not aspire to deliver a clear or logical message, what so ever.  It&rsquo;s
basically just something I need to get off my chest.</p>

<p>It was not until 2007 I first learned about the event based approach
to programming and event libraries like
<a href="http://libevent.org/">libevent</a> and
<a href="http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html">libev</a>.  Up until that
point the silver bullet everyone was using was &hellip; Threads.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really know when it all started, maybe it was the Linux
revolution, the first NPTL release with GLIBC, Java or Solaris.
Nevertheless, from my point of view it was sometime in the mid 90&rsquo;s
during my time at university that the use of threads was starting to
become prevalent.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='With the rise of the thread based model of programming we now had a
hammer, and every problem looked like a nail.'>
With the rise of the thread based model of programming we now had a
hammer, and every problem looked like a nail.  I had a gut feeling
there was something really wrong with using threads for every
conceivable program, but I could not find a way to express it, so I
chugged away with my threads, semaphores and condition variables.  I
convinced myself I was happy like this.
</span></p>

<p>Of course I knew about the event based approach, but it was more or
less dismissed as a thing of the past, a while(1) loop to mimic the
behavior of PLC&rsquo;s.  So almost every program I wrote, and every program
I took over from others, were like Indiana Jones types of mazes full
of deadlocks and race conditions.</p>

<p>I thought I did something wrong, and so did many others like me.  I
spent days and nights trying to understand, refactor, and redesign
threaded programs.  What I found was a doubt that the thread based
model actually didn&rsquo;t suit every problem,
<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2009/cs4210_fall/papers/ousterhout-threads.pdf">Ous96</a>.
There are quite a few domains, however, where thread based models
shine. Usually in languages that come with thread support built-in,
like Erlang.</p>

<p>Most of the programs I work with today are network daemons.  Meaning
they are essentially message based applications that spend a lot of
time waiting for an event to occur: receiving a data frame, waiting
for a timer to expire, a signal to be raised, etc.  Of course threads
can be used for this, but it is a lot simpler to employ an event based
framework instead.  Also, they are all written in C for speed and
portability between different UNIX systems.  For that domain, where I
currently make my living, it will be difficult to convince me to ever
look at threads again.</p>
