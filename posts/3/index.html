  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK, so you&#8217;ve just been handed the task to integrate a big piece of
corporate software and it&#8217;s nowhere near as done and ready as project
management thinks.  Of course you&#8217;ve already started chugging away at
it, fixing bugs, refactoring code and wrapping it in neat containers
to keep the changeset against the base SW small &#8211; you already know
you&#8217;ll get another drop of the same stinking pieace of code in another
six months, so you keep the changes small and track them in GIT with
neatly formatted commit messages.</p>

<p>About ten commits in it dawns on you that you have several commits
that would need to be squashed and some commit messages that needs to
be edited &#8230; you start typing in <code>git rebase -i origin/...</code> wait, you
haven&#8217;t pushed anything yet.  So how do you rebase something that&#8217;s
not been pushed yet?</p>

<p>Well:</p>

<pre><code>git rebase --interactive --root master
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I feel I have to write something about the demise of
<a href="http://freecode.com">free(code)</a>.
<a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5936">Others</a> have written about it too,
and its been covered on <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/603403/">lwn.net</a> as
well.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s actually a rather depressing development.  They claim it&#8217;s due to
the low traffic and decline in updates, but it&#8217;s evident that&#8217;s not
the whole truth.  The owners recommend their other site, SourceForge,
but anyone having been in the loop for the last decade or two knows
that SourceForge has been in a slow decline for a long time, more so
than free(code) in my opinion.  Also, SourceForge only lists its own
projects, and only the most active or &#8220;top&#8221; projects.</p>

<p>I never used free(code) to find the &#8220;top&#8221; projects or the most active
ones.  That&#8217;s completely useless to me.  I went there to dig for small
unknown projects, small gems that are usually unlisted on GitHub or
SourceForge.  I went there to publicize my own small creations, learn
about other similar projects and get a quick feedback on recent
changes of new releases to projects I was interested in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The last couple of weeks have both seen the birth of the fabulous
<a href="/uftpd.html">uftpd</a> and a reignited <a href="/inadyn.html">inadyn</a> project!
Yesterday v1.2 of uftpd was released and today Inadyn saw the first
working HTTPS support being released as v1.99.8!  This is likely the
last release of Inadyn before the big 2.0, which will introduce the
new .conf file format based on
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/">libConfuse</a>.  A .conf file
feasibility study was
<a href="/blog/2014/02/23/weekend-hack-json-vs-conf/">presented earlier</a> &#8230;</p>

<p>The uftpd project is completely based on user input, currently mostly
mine.  I will add features and bug fixes when I need them, unless I
get more input.  So I welcome anyone to clone it on GitHub and hack
away.  As usual, I will accept any sane patches that adhere to the
coding style and is well written.  The same goes for Inadyn, only with
the added request that the changes are thoroughly tested first, since
I cannot maintain multiple accounts on various DDNS providers myself.</p>

<p>Patches to support flavors of UNIX other than GNU/Linux, including
GNU/Hurd, or even other operating systems are also welcome, as long as
it&#8217;s not Windows.  I will not maintain any Windows support since I
don&#8217;t use it myself.  If you want Windows support you will have to
take a very active co-maintainer role in the respective project.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Looking for a Dynamic DNS, DDNS, client?  Well you&#8217;re in luck, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_free_software" title="FLOSS">FLOSS</a> market space is flooded with dedicated clients and various
wget scripts.  So why bother with an old C implementation?  Well, this
is admittedly one of the old timers in the game and is likely packaged
for your GNU/Linux distribution of choice already.  It&#8217;s tried and
tested with many DDNS service providers and even comes bundled in a
few embedded router distributions as well.</p>

<p>Today I&#8217;ve released <a href="/inadyn.html">Inadyn</a> v1.99.7 as an XZ compressed
tarball.  The release announcement should be up on <a href="https://freecode.com/projects/inadyn">free(code)</a>
now.  It&#8217;s a small incremental release containing mainly code cleanup
and a few new features that you likely won&#8217;t notice: support for
multiple cache files and DDNS providers as separate plugins, for easy
addition of new ones as well as maintenance of existing.  This further
separates the internal logic from the provider specific parts and also
helps reduce clutter to ease maintenance.</p>

<p>This is a small incremental release building up to the long awaited
v2.0, which will include the long-awaited HTTPS support and also a new
.conf file format.  The latter is not really welcomed with open arms
by users, but is a necessary step since the current parser is heavily
affected by bit rot and must be put down.  I will attempt to make the
transition as easy as possible, but you will need to change you .conf
files.</p>

<p>Maybe a preview of the HTTPS support will make it into a release that
still has the old .conf file format, but just maybe.</p>

something like this 2014?</p>

<p>As a developer the answer to most such questions is usually; to
scratch an itch.  For a very long time I&#8217;ve looked for a really simple
FTP server that just works, out of the box!</p>

<p>Nothing fancy this time, just collecting some bug fixes, playing with
cppcheck a bit and adding support for including .conf files.  Quite
useful if you want to partition your configuration, or if you share
major pieces of configuration between different platforms.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>So, we finally got Google Music &amp; Movies services in Sweden!  The
prices seem a bit on the steep side, apart from maybe the Music
service, which is slightly cheaper than Spotify.  Will try it out for
a month or so to see which one I like better.</p>

<p>For some reason I chose Gravity as my first rental, at 39 Skr.  I&#8217;ve
heard so many bad reviews of it but for better or worse it&#8217;ll now be
my introduction to Google Movies :-)</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was time.  I had been putting it off for far too long &#8211; learning
about JSON and deciding on a new .conf file format for
<a href="/inadyn.shtml">Inadyn</a>.  So this weekend I sat myself down to read up
on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> and the multitude of
parser libraries for both JSON and traditional .conf file parsers.  I
was looking for a human readable file format that a user could easily
and reliably edit by themselves without it being too error prone or
sensitive to mistyping.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/9177645.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;You are being &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gist/9177645&quot;&gt;redirected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>I quickly narrowed down my scope of investigation to
<a href="http://www.digip.org/jansson/">Jansson</a> for JSON and and
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/">Confuse</a> for &#8220;standard&#8221; UNIX .conf
files.  Both have very liberal licenses, extensive test suites, very
good documentation and are extremely well written!  In fact, I will
probably use them as prime examples of well maintained Open Source
projects in the future :-)</p>

<p>The resulting code is in my
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/toolbox/tree/master/conf">toolbox</a> on
GitHub.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/9177620.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;You are being &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gist/9177620&quot;&gt;redirected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>In my opinion the .conf file is a lot easier to read, write and edit
by Joe User, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll be using for many of my own projects,
starting with <a href="/inadyn.shtml">Inadyn</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes people ask me what I do for a living.  Usually I tend to
pause and think, real hard, becuase the people asking me this aren&#8217;t
programmers.  They use computers, but are mostly limited to a Windows
machine, writing in MS Word and browsing the Internet, mostly for
Facebook.</p>

<p>I often start off with: &#8220;It&#8217;s a bit complicated to explain &#8230; &#8220;, by
which time I&#8217;ve lost most of the people in the room listening to me.
Sometimes I say: &#8220;I&#8217;m a software architect.&#8221;, because people seem to
know what architects do for a living, they draw houses, design stuff
and drive SAAB&#8217;s.  Much like dentists.  The prefix &#8220;software&#8221; however
does confuse people.</p>
