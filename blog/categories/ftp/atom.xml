    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Quite a few changes lately.  I finally got around to adding support
for <a href="http://www.gnutls.org">GnuTLS</a> to <a href="/inadyn.html">Inadyn</a>,
hopefully this will get into Debian &hellip; unless the Jessie freeze
prevents that.</p>

<p>Also, thanks to a friend of mine trying out <a href="/uftpd.html">uftpd</a>
recently I discovered that libuev has been missing from the tarball
since the release of the TFTP support.  Fixed.</p>

<p>Another great piece of news is that
<a href="http://www.coverity.com/">Coverity</a> accepted uftpd as an Open Source
project, I&rsquo;ve been hard at work fixing nasty bugs uncovered by the
<a href="https://scan.coverity.com/">Coverity Scan</a>.  Great stuff! :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><blockquote><p>So them pesky details of <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> really are important?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>This is a small bugfix release of <a href="/uftpd.html">uftpd</a>.  Version 1.4
is basically just to change <code>nowait</code> to <code>wait</code> for the TFTP service in
<code>/etc/inetd.conf</code>, but there&rsquo;s also a minor man page update.</p>

<p>Enjoy! :)</p>

    <id>http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2014/09/02/new-release-of-the-awesome-uftpd</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today sees the release of v1.3 of the awesome little uftpd. The main
news is the new TFTP support!  Just like before you don&rsquo;t need any
configuration file, just build and install &ndash; or build a .deb file and
install.</p>

<p>This release completes the main purpose of uftpd for me, I can now use
it as my daily driver and fully replace vsftpd and tftpd-hpa, which to
me are the next best.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s left then, you ask?  Well, TFTP upload support, TFTP segment
size negotiation and possibly multiple user support in FTP.  As
always, patches are most welcome.  See the
<a href="/uftpd.html">uftpd homepage</a> and my
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/uftpd/">GitHub project</a> for details.</p>

    <id>http://troglobit.github.io/blog/2014/05/20/new-release-of-uftpd-and-inadyn-dot-dot-dot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last couple of weeks have both seen the birth of the fabulous
<a href="/uftpd.html">uftpd</a> and a reignited <a href="/inadyn.html">inadyn</a> project!
Yesterday v1.2 of uftpd was released and today Inadyn saw the first
working HTTPS support being released as v1.99.8!  This is likely the
last release of Inadyn before the big 2.0, which will introduce the
new .conf file format based on
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/">libConfuse</a>.  A .conf file
feasibility study was
<a href="/blog/2014/02/23/weekend-hack-json-vs-conf/">presented earlier</a> &hellip;</p>

<p>The uftpd project is completely based on user input, currently mostly
mine.  I will add features and bug fixes when I need them, unless I
get more input.  So I welcome anyone to clone it on GitHub and hack
away.  As usual, I will accept any sane patches that adhere to the
coding style and is well written.  The same goes for Inadyn, only with
the added request that the changes are thoroughly tested first, since
I cannot maintain multiple accounts on various DDNS providers myself.</p>

<p>Patches to support flavors of UNIX other than GNU/Linux, including
GNU/Hurd, or even other operating systems are also welcome, as long as
it&rsquo;s not Windows.  I will not maintain any Windows support since I
don&rsquo;t use it myself.  If you want Windows support you will have to
take a very active co-maintainer role in the respective project.</p>
