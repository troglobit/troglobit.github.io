    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a response to the excellent post by Jani Gor≈°e, titled
<a href="https://blooki.st/BlookElement/ShowTextPhoto?blookElementId=1962">Why is Programming an Art?</a></p>

<p>Ever since I began studying Computer Engineering at
<a href="http://www.mdh.se">university</a> back in 1995 I have struggled to find
the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; ways to format my code, name functions and variables
appropriately, structure functions into files and files into
directories with Makefiles and Makefile snippets, using both recursive
and non-recursive make.  Formatting of code, for instance, was for a
while a bit of an obsession of mine, and it sort of is still.  But
today I am more concerned with the overall structure and how
components interact.  Even though I can still get very annoyed at
people naming their local variables obtrusively.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practice-Programming-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/020161586X"><img class="right" src="/images/Practice_of_Programming.jpeg" width="222" height="155"></a></p>

<p>I still do most of my work, professional and hobby, using plain old C.
I&rsquo;ve read many books and style guides on the subject and the one that
really stood out as being extremely helpful, apart from reading a LOT
of code, is
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practice-Programming-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/020161586X">The Practice of Programming</a>
by Kernighan and Pike!  The book is crammed full with tons of neat
advice and best practises that simly just make sense.  Stuff like
&ldquo;name your local variables i, j, k for counters and loop variables&rdquo;,
which is basically what most of us do already.  Just read it and
you&rsquo;ll see what I mean &ndash; spot on!</p>

<p>Spot on? I hear you say, why should you read something that seemingly
doesn&rsquo;t tell you anything you already know?  Well, even the most
evident practises often come under scrutiny when programmers from the
most different schools meet.  At my job we have Microsoft, Bombardier,
and ABB programmers which have little to no experience with UNIX,
Linux or any Free/Open Source software development.  They are used to
more cumbersome practises, &ldquo;Hungarian Style Notation&rdquo;, inflexible
corporate styles which nobody can explain anymore, and so on.</p>

<p>It is difficult to explain the way of Free/Open Source software, but I
think the most important message is: keep it simple, maintain the same
style as used in the rest of the project, and if you comment then
write what you mean with a piece of code, not what it does.  And, in
the true style of UNIX, write one program that does its job well.</p>

<p>The beuty in software comes from the structure, the flow, the
similarities and how the modules fit together.  The absence of
duplication, and the readability.</p>

<p>Visit the
<a href="http://www.informit.com/store/practice-of-programming-9780201615869">homepage for the book</a>
and download the source code to have a look for yourself.  Enjoy!</p>
