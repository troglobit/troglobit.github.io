    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a certain &ldquo;burstyness&rdquo; to the way I work on my open source
projects.  It seems it often coincides with intense work loads during
new release cycles at <a href="http://www.westermo.com">work</a>.</p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;ve just finished restoring two pages that got lost in the
big server crash:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="/mrouted.shtml">mrouted</a></li>
<li> <a href="/pimd.shtml">pimd</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Big thanks goes to the <a href="http://www.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> for
maintaining records of the original pages I lost!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Quite some time has passed now since our old site, <a href="http://vmlinux.org,">http://vmlinux.org,</a>
crashed and burned, and with it much of my previous Open Source work
and blogs.  Tech blog entries, archives for the projects I maintain,
lost.</p>

<p>Backups? Of course not.</p>

<p>This all happened in 2011.  Since then we also managed to lose the
domain and I kind of lost myself for a while, including my motivation.</p>

<p>Fortunately, at this point in time I had migrated most of my projects
from CVS and Subversion to DVCS&#8217; like Bzr and GIT, so I could easily
setup new homes for most of my Open Source projects at
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Recently however GitHub stopped serving downloads, so even though I
can continue using it for version control, I had to find a new way of
serving generated tarballs and the like.  See <a href="ftp://troglobit.com">my
FTP</a> for project downloads.</p>

<p>I had also started missing blogging for some reason. So it started to
make sense to roll something on my own again.  Well, here&rsquo;s me
starting over.</p>

<p>See you soon with more posts about open source projects, releases of
projects I maintain, Emacs tips, and ramblings about techie stuff I
like!  :-)</p>
