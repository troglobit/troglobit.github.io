    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the better part of the last ten years I&#8217;ve been working with
multicast in one way or another.  I&#8217;ve used many different tools for
testing, but usually simply using <code>ping(1)</code> and <code>tcpdump(1)</code> is quite
sufficient.  However, you often need to tell bridges (switches) to open
up multicast in your general direction for your pings to get through, so
you need to send an IGMP &#8220;join&#8221; first.  I found mcjoin, written by David
Stevens, in <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/5/143">this posting to LKML</a>
back in 2006, and started improving it and adding features to it over
the years.</p>

<p>Now, my interest and fascination with multicast only grew with time,
and despite elegant tools like <code>mgen(1)</code> and <code>omping(1)</code> I was never
quite happy.</p>

<p>When releasing SMCRoute v2.1.0 recently, and currently working on the
pimd v2.3.2 release, I was so tired of having to do so many manual steps
just to verify correct operation of a routing daemon.  Therefore I spent
the better part of the weekend fixing up my old mcjoin tool.</p>

<p>I wanted a reliable, simple, and UNIX-y tool to just test things for me.
So I cleaned up the old mcjoin project, first by migrating it from the
toolbox repo, then remove confusing command line options, improve and
simplify the syntax, and then added send/receive capabilities.  Been
meaning to get around to this for ages, and now it seems I had finally
had enough.  So here it is, v2.0:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/troglobit/mcjoin/">https://github.com/troglobit/mcjoin/</a></li>
<li><strong>ChangeLog</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/troglobit/mcjoin/releases/tag/v2.0">https://github.com/troglobit/mcjoin/releases/tag/v2.0</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Most of the time I simply want to see a resulting IGMP join message in
Wireshark, see it bite in a switch&#8217;s FDB or a routing daemon&#8217;s
forwarding table.  So, join is the default operation, and also continues
to be the name of the tool.  My favourite testing group is set as the
default, 225.1.2.3, so you only need to start the tool and you&#8217;re off.
To send to the same default group (225.1.2.3), simply add <code>-s</code> to the
sender side.</p>

<pre><code>sender$ mcjoin -s
^C
sender$

receiver$ mcjoin
joined group 225.1.2.3 on eth0 ...
..................................................................^C
Received total: 66 packets
receiver$
</code></pre>

<p>If you ever need anything else, e.g. routing multicast, there&#8217;s even a
man page.  It mentions setting the TTL and other such nastiness :)</p>
