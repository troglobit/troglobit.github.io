`watchdogd(8)` is an advanced system and process supervisor daemon.
It can monitor critical system resources, supervise the heartbeat of
processes, record deadline transgressions, and reset the system.

When a system comes back up after a reset, `watchdogd` determines the
reset cause and records it in a logfile for later analysis by an
operator or network management system (NMS).  This information can in
turn then be used to put the system in an operational safe state, or
non-operational safe state.


### What is a watchdog timer?

Most server and laptop motherboards today come equipped with a watchdog
timer (WDT).  It is a small timer connected to the reset circuitry so
that it can reset the board if the timer expires.  The system watchdog
driver, and this daemon, periodically "kick", or reset the timer to
prevent it from firing.

Most embedded systems utilise watchdog timers as a way to automatically
recover from malfunctions.

The Linux kernel provides a common userspace interface `/dev/watchdog`,
created automatically when the appropriate watchdog driver is loaded.
If your board does not have a WDT, the kernel provides a "softdog"
module which in many cases can be good enough.

The idea of a watchdog daemon in userspace is to run in the background
of your system.  When there is no more CPU time for the watchdog daemon
to run it will fail to "kick" the WDT.  This will in turn cause the WDT
to reboot the system.  This background process can of course also be
used to monitor other aspects of the system.


### What can watchdogd do?

Without arguments `watchdogd` runs in the background, monitoring the the
CPU, and as long as there is CPU time it "kicks" the WDT chip (via the
driver).  However, with few command line options it can also monitor
other aspect of the system, such as:

- Load average
- Memory leaks
- File descriptor leaks
- Process live locks


Usage
-----

```shell
    watchdogd [-hnsVvx] [-a WARN,REBOOT] [-T SEC] [-t SEC] [/dev/watchdog]
    
    Options:
      -n, --foreground         Start in foreground (background is default)
      -s, --syslog             Use syslog, even if running in foreground
      -l, --loglevel=LVL       Log level: none, err, info, notice*, debug
      
      -T, --timeout=SEC        HW watchdog timer (WDT) timeout in SEC seconds
      -t, --interval=SEC       WDT kick interval in SEC seconds, default: 10
      -x, --safe-exit          Disable watchdog on exit from SIGINT/SIGTERM
      
      -a, --load-average=W,R   Enable load average check WARN,REBOOT
      -m, --meminfo=W,R        Enable memory leak check, WARN,REBOOT
      -f, --filenr=W,R         Enable file descriptor leak check, WARN,REBOOT
      -p, --pmon[=PRIO]        Enable process monitor, run at elevated RT prio
                               Default RT prio when active: SCHED_RR @98
      
      -v, --version            Display version and exit
      -h, --help               Display this help message and exit
```

By default, with any arguments given on the command line, `watchdogd`
opens `/dev/watchdog`, forks to the background and then tries to to set
a 20 sec WDT timeout.  It then kicks every 10 sec.  See below, in the
Operation section, for more information.

**Example**

```shell
    watchdogd -a 0.8,0.9 -T 120 -t 30 /dev/watchdog2
```

Most WDT drivers only support 120 sec as lowest timeout, but `watchdogd`
tries to set 20 sec timeout.  Example values above are recommendations.

`watchdogd` runs at the default UNIX priority (nice) level, unless the
process monitor is activated, in which case it runs at an elevated real
time priority.


Features
--------

To force a kernel watchdog reboot, `watchdogd` supports `SIGPWR`, used
by some `init(1)` systems to delegate a reboot.  What it does is to set
the WDT timer to the lowest possible value (1 sec), close the connection
to `/dev/watchdog`, and wait for WDT reboot.  It waits at most 3x the
WDT timeout before announcing HW WDT failure and forcing a reboot.

`watchdogd(8)` supports optional monitoring of several system resources.
First, system load average monitoring can be enabled with `-a 0.8,0.9`.
Second, the memory leak detector `-m 0.9,0.95`.  Third, file descriptor
leak detector `-f 0.8,0.95`.  All *very* useful on an embedded system.

The two values, separated by a comma, are the warning and reboot levels
in percent.  For the loadavg monitoring it is important to know that the
trigger levels are normalized.  This means `watchdogd` does not care how
many CPU cores your system has online.  If the kernel `/proc/loadavg`
file shows `3.9 3.0 2.5` on a four-core CPU, `watchdogd` will consider
this as a load of `0.98 0.75 0.63`, i.e. divided by four.  Only the one
(1) and five (5) minute average values are used.  For more information
on the UNIX load average, see this [StackOverflow question][loadavg].

The RAM usage monitor only triggers on systems without swap.  This is
detected by reading the file `/proc/meminfo`, looking for the
`SwapTotal:` value.  For more details on the underlying mechanisms of
file descriptor usage, see [this article][filenr].  For more info on the
details of memory usage, see [this article][meminfo].

`watchdogd` v2.0 comes with a process monitor, pmon.  It must be enabled
and a monitored client must connect using the API for pmon to start.  As
soon pmon starts it raises the real-time priority of watchdogd to 98 to
be able to ensure proper monitoring of its clients.


Pmon API
--------

To use pmon a client must have its source code instrumented with at
least a "subscribe" and a "kick" call.  Commonly this is achieved by
adding the `wdog_pmon_kick()` call to the main event loop.

All API calls, except `wdog_pmon_ping()`, return POSIX OK(0) or negative
value with `errno` set on error.  The `wdog_pmon_subscribe()` call
returns a positive integer (including zero) for the watchdog `id`.

```C

    /*
     * Enable or disable watchdogd at runtime.
     */
    int wdog_enable           (int enable);
    int wdog_status           (int *enabled);
    
    /*
     * Check if watchdogd API is actively responding,
     * returns %TRUE(1) or %FALSE(0)
     */
    int wdog_pmon_ping        (void);

    /*
     * Register with pmon, timeout in msec.  Return value is the `id`
     * to be used with the `ack` in subsequent kick()/unsubscribe()
     */
    int wdog_pmon_subscribe   (char *label, int timeout, int *ack);
    int wdog_pmon_unsubscribe (int id, int ack);
    int wdog_pmon_kick        (int id, int *ack);

```

It is highly recommended to use an event loop like libev, [libuev][], or
similar.  For such libraries one can simply add a timer callback for the
kick to run periodically to monitor proper operation of the client.


### Example

For other applications, identify your main loop, its max period time and
instrument it like this:

```C

    int ack, wid;
    
    /* Library will use process' name on NULL first arg. */
    wid = wdog_pmon_subscribe(NULL, 10000, &ack);
    if (-1 == wid)
            ;      /* Error handling */
    
    while (1) {
            ...
            wdog_pmon_kick(wid, &ack);
            ...
    }

```

This simple example subscribes to the watchdog with a 10 sec timeout.
The received `wid` is used in the call to `wdog_pmon_kick()`, along with
the received `ack` value.  Which is changed every time the application
calls `wdog_pmon_kick()`.  The application should of course check the
return value of `wdog_pmon_subscribe()` for errors, that code is left
out of the example to make it easier to read.

See also the [example/ex1.c][ex1] in the source distribution.  This is
used by the automatic tests.


Operation
---------

By default, `watchdogd` forks off a daemon in the background, opens the
`/dev/watchdog` device, attempts to set the default WDT timeout to 20
seconds and then goes into an endless loop where it kicks the watchdog
every 10 seconds.

If a device driver does not support setting the WDT timeout, `watchdogd`
attempts to query the actual (possibly hard coded) watchdog timeout and
then uses half that time as the kick interval.

When `watchdogd` backgrounds itself syslog is implicitly used for all
informational and debug messages.  If a user requests to run the daemon
in the foreground `watchdogd` will also log to `STDERR` and `STDOUT`,
unless the user gives the `--syslog` argument to force use of syslog.


Debugging
---------

The code has both `INFO()` and `DEBUG()` statements sprinkled almost
everywhere.  Use the `--loglevel=debug` command line option to enable
full debug output to stderr or the syslog, depending on how you start
`watchdogd`.


Build & Install
---------------

`watchdogd` is tailored for Linux systems and should build against any
(old) C libray.  However, `watchdogd` v2.1 and later require two
external libraries that were previously a built-in, [libite][]
and [libuEv][].  Neither of them should present any surprises, both use
de facto standard `configure` scripts and support `pkg-config` which the
`watchdogd` `configure` script use to locate requried libraries and
header files.

Hence, the regular `./configure && make` is usually sufficient to build
`watchdogd`.  But, if libraries are installed in non-standard locations
you may need to provide their paths:

```shell
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/lib/pkgconfig:/home/ian/lib/pkgconfig ./configure
    make
```
