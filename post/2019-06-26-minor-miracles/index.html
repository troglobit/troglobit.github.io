        <p>The last six months at work have been really stressful, so to finally
get a week off for Swedish Midsummer celebrations was really what the
doctor ordered!  I&rsquo;ve managed to wind down and relax, spend time with my
kids and my family, and even put in some time on my personal software
projects!</p>
<p>Three years ago I forked <a href="http://acme.com/software/thttpd/">thttpd</a> and began merging patches I&rsquo;d found
scattered around the net.  I&rsquo;ve also added a few features of my own, and
to avoid any confusion with the original (bug free!) project, I renamed
the resulting monster <a href="https://merecat.troglobit.com/">Merecat</a> and it
has served <a href="http://troglobit.com">http://troglobit.com</a> and its subdomains since then.  Test
in production, yo!</p>
<p>Last year I added native support for HTTPS to Merecat, but it was still
not possible to serve both HTTP and HTTPS from the same httpd process,
so I began a slow refactor which I&rsquo;ve now finalized! \o/</p>
<p>With a little help from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a>, I now
have <a href="https://troglobit.com">https://troglobit.com</a> up and running, and the HTTP site is also
running &ndash; soon with automatic redirect to the HTTPS site.</p>
<p>Vacation works, it really does.</p>
