        <p>Anyone who knows me knows I&rsquo;m quite stubborn.  Whenever I set my sights
on something I finish it.  The last couple of years I&rsquo;ve been quite busy
on GitHub, making at least one commit per day.  I&rsquo;ve had a lot of things
I&rsquo;ve wanted to do and complete, and this commit regimen has kept me on
track to do just that.</p>

<p>However, nothing comes for free, and although I&rsquo;ve achieved my goals,
I&rsquo;ve also had to make a lot of sacrifices.  Ask my kids, or my ex-wife
&hellip; So as a New Year&rsquo;s resolution to myself I&rsquo;ve begun a new journey
which likely will significantly reduce the amount of Open Source work I
do.</p>
<p>I still have a few software and hardware projects that I want to finish:
v1.0 of TroglOS, the embedded devboard I&rsquo;ve developed to showcase all my
projects, the Macchiatobin board bring-up (using TroglOS and Alpine
Linux), and some other bits and pieces.  After that things will start to
trickle down to a bare minimum to handle bug reports and do patch
releases.</p>
<p>Over the next couple of weeks/months I will talk a bit more here on my
blog about all the projects and what they can be used for.</p>
<p>Stay tuned! :-)</p>
