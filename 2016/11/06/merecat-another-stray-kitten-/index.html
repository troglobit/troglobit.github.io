    <p>This post is about my adoption, refactor, and rebranding of thttpd as
<a href="http://merecat.troglobit.com">Merecat</a>.</p>
<p>I code for recreation as well as work.  Most of the time I tinker around
with my various <a href="https://github.com/troglobit">projects</a> simply to learn
and sometimes these little projects turn into something useful for other
people as well, which is great!</p>
<p data-pullquote="not all things can be simplified, and not all simple
things are correct"> Recently I discovered my method to get started:
refactoring, or just simple code cleanup.  You see I've got this crazy
idea that <em>all simple things are correct</em>.  Although things
usually tend to require a certain balance &mdash; not all things can be
simplified, and not all simple things are correct.</p>
<p>When I recently had to migrate my personal blog, FTP, and GIT server, I
set out to run everything from an old RasPi2.  This put my private life
in just about the same niche as my work life, embedded.  On a resource
constrained platform like that running Apache is not the best idea.  So
I set out to (re-)discover the web servers of my past, the late 90&rsquo;s, I
had almost forgotten:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://acme.com/software/mini_httpd/">mini_httpd</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boa.org/">Boa</a>,</li>
<li>BusyBox httpd,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/">thttpd</a>,</li>
<li>and more &hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>Come to think of it, they are probably one of the many reasons that I
started my career in embedded in the first place!</p>
<p>With all the warm feels and fuzzy memories I had of thttpd I decided to
give it a whirl.  And with my usual lack of insight (of how much time
this would consume) I started fixing bugs and issues that nagged me.</p>
<p>Ten patches in I hesitated and set out on another archaeological
expedition, surely I couldn&rsquo;t have seen all these problems myself?  I
visited the usual burial grounds for ancient software: *BSD, Debian,
Gentoo, SourceForge, Internet Archive &hellip; and that&rsquo;s when I found
<a href="https://github.com/blueness/sthttpd/">sthttpd</a> by Anthony G. Basile.</p>
<p>Anthony had left sthttpd in great shape!  Not only had he merged all
Gentoo fixes, he had also converted the build system to GNU configure
and automake.  So I started rebasing my patches on sthttpd and then I
simply couldn&rsquo;t stop.  The refactoring machine in my head was on fire, I
simpy had to let it all out!</p>
<p>The goal I had was a simple to use, good looking by default, bare bones
web server.  My use-case was simple: serve gitweb, HTTP gateway for my
FTP, serve my resumé, and possibly even my Jekyll blog.  So I basically
just needed to get virtual hosts and dir listings working.</p>
<p>In the process, however, I had done a lot more. Lots of half baked ideas
and barely working code.  But it worked for me, so I tagged the first
release of Merecat, v2.30, and went on my merry way.</p>
<p>Until the RasPi server crashed.  I thought it might be heat and maybe
overclocking issues, so I moved it to my server room and downclocked it.
A few weeks passed and everything seemed to work just fine, then bam!
Another crash, and now it only stayed up a few hours at a time between
crashes.</p>
<p>Heartbroken (well not really) I decided it was time to move to the cloud
like everyone else.  So a droplet was created (clear of US influence I
hope) and data was being moved to the new location.  This time I wanted
the setup to be as clean as possible, so only Debian packages and proper
systemd integration.  Fortunately I had a well timed week off from work
to do all this.</p>
<p>I had just barely started digging in, when I got a bug report by email
from Gaetan Bisson who had found lots of issues with Merecat.  The bugs
he reported overlapped nicely with the work I planned to do anyway \o/</p>
<p>The resulting v2.31 release of Merecat has a lot of fixes and new
features, these are the ones I can remember (and are in the GitHub
changelog):</p>
<h3 id="changes">Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sort directories first in dir listings</li>
<li>Include systemd unit file</li>
<li>Add <code>debian/</code> packaging, easy to rebuild and replace for others</li>
<li>Add <code>--enable-public-html</code> to enable <code>~user/public_html</code> dirs</li>
<li>Support for shared <code>WEBROOT/cgi-bin</code> as fallback for vhosts</li>
<li>Update default landing page</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add missing CSS and jpeg files to install</li>
<li>Fix dependency tracking when reconfiguring</li>
<li>Fix .conf file parser bugs reported by Gaetan Bisson</li>
<li>Fix missing <code>HAVE_LIBCONFUSE</code> #define causing .conf file support to
not be built, reported by Gaetan Bisson</li>
<li>Fix malplaced call to <code>cfg_free()</code> in .conf file parser, reported by
Gaetan Bisson</li>
<li>Update man page and other documentation with missing quotes around CGI
pattern, issue reported by Gaetan Bisson</li>
<li>Fix syslog warning: bind 0.0.0.0: Address already in use</li>
</ul>
<p>Download the release from my <a href="http://ftp.troglobit.com">FTP</a>, or the
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/merecat/releases/tag/v2.31">GitHub release page</a>,
which also has a pre-built .deb for Ubuntu 16.04.  For those who want to
build the .deb themselves:</p>
<pre><code>cd merecat/
dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -B -d
</code></pre>
<p>Then simply:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dpkg -i ../merecat_2.31-3_amd64.deb
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For use with GitWeb, remember to install <code>libcgi-pm-perl</code></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to thank a couple of friends who
helped out with the auditing and layout testing of the new default
landing page.  Thank you Anders Bornäs and Martin Olsson :-)</p>
