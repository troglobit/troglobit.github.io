      <h1>On the demise of free(code) ...</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I feel I have to write something about the demise of
<a href="http://freecode.com">free(code)</a>.
<a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5936">Others</a> have written about it too,
and its been covered on <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/603403/">lwn.net</a> as
well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a rather depressing development.  They claim it&rsquo;s due to
the low traffic and decline in updates, but it&rsquo;s evident that&rsquo;s not
the whole truth.  The owners recommend their other site, SourceForge,
but anyone having been in the loop for the last decade or two knows
that SourceForge has been in a slow decline for a long time, more so
than free(code) in my opinion.  Also, SourceForge only lists its own
projects, and only the most active or &ldquo;top&rdquo; projects.</p>
<p>I never used free(code) to find the &ldquo;top&rdquo; projects or the most active
ones.  That&rsquo;s completely useless to me.  I went there to dig for small
unknown projects, small gems that are usually unlisted on GitHub or
SourceForge.  I went there to publicize my own small creations, learn
about other similar projects and get a quick feedback on recent
changes of new releases to projects I was interested in.</p>
<p>There exist no real replacement to free(code), except perhaps for
<a href="https://www.openhub.net/">Open Hub</a>, previously known as
<a href="http://www.ohloh.net">Ohloh</a>.  The
<a href="http://directory.fsf.org">Free Software Directory</a> could perhaps have
become something over time, but unfortunately feels like yet another
<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">Cathedral Style</a>
project from the FSF.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love the FSF and almost
everything they do, but they often get lost in their old tradition of
big closed off idealistic projects.  Eric S. Raymond has
<a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5948">a proposal</a> for replacing free(code)
and he is that sort of pragmatic person that could get something off
the ground.  In any case it&rsquo;ll be interesting, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>Some people say all the action is on GitHub these days, but that&rsquo;s
just like an echo of the glory days of CVS, Subversion and the start
of the new millenia when we should all use SourceForge.  Been there,
done that, and yes I do use GitHub, but again it doesn&rsquo;t list anything
but GitHub projects &hellip;</p>
<p>Other people say that to promote your small projects you need to
become active in a Linux distro, or write about them in magazines or
on <a href="http://hackerne.ws">Hacker News</a> &hellip; well, I&rsquo;d like very much to
become a Debian developer one day, but the process to become one seems
so increadibly daunting!  Also, I&rsquo;m not a writer, nor am I a native
English speaker, I&rsquo;m
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JustaProgrammer">just a programmer</a> and I
really miss free(code)!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect this blog to have any readers at all, so using it as
the sole platform for announcing new releases is rather pointless.  So
I&rsquo;ve started playing around with
<a href="https://www.openhub.net/accounts/troglobit">Open Hub</a> for my own most
relevant projects.  It has some nice stats and other useful features
that I can use.  Hopefully it can serve as a replacement for my most
basic needs.</p>
