      <h1>Why write your own FTP server?</h1>
    </header>

    <p>So, I finally got fed up with all other FTP servers and wrote
<a href="https://troglobit.com/uftpd.html">my own</a>.  Why would someone in their right mind do
something like this 2014?</p>
<p>As a developer the answer to most such questions is usually; to
scratch an itch.  For a very long time I&rsquo;ve looked for a really simple
FTP server that just works, out of the box!</p>
<p>My alternatives on GNU/Linux distributions have been: several variants
of the original <a href="https://github.com/mit-athena/ftpd">MIT/Athena ftpd</a>,
<a href="http://www.proftpd.org/">ProFTPD</a>,
<a href="http://www.pureftpd.org/project/pure-ftpd">Pure-FTPd</a>, and
<a href="https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html">vstfptd</a>.  Most of them are
too damn difficult to configure, have ugly configuration files or are
plainly just too confusing.  With one exception, vsftpd.  I really
like vsftpd!  It&rsquo;s got a simple and well documented configuration file
(inline as comments) and always worked almost painlessly for me.</p>
<p>However, over the past couple of Ubuntu LTS installations it&rsquo;s been
starting to act up on me.  Not allowing me to have a group-writable
root directory, and not even an ability to disable that security
feature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple really.  I&rsquo;m a developer.  I have colleagues.  We share
servers at work.  We bootstrap and upgrade our embedded devices using
TFTP/FTP.  We have one directory, usually <code>/srv/ftp</code>, which is group
writable and all developers are members of that group.  Anyone can
upload a file there and the file servers &hellip; would you know &hellip; are
supposed to <em>serve</em> that file, as TFTP or anonymous FTP.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m a fringe user?  Maybe secured local area networks, or laptop
to embedded device crossed-cables networks, are no longer the &ldquo;fad&rdquo;?
Maybe a sane built-in default is no longer cool or hipster enough?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anymore, and this time I was so fed up chasing around for
answers to &ldquo;How to setup your &lsquo;favorite&rsquo; FTP Server&rdquo;, that I just sat
down and fixed it once and for all.  I figured I&rsquo;d otherwise be doing
this waltz over and over again, just like I already have, for the next
10 years &hellip;</p>
<p>I trawled the net once more for good candidates, this time for
adoption and holy cow sacrifices.  I wanted a very simple base to
start from, which I could cut up into pieces, iteratively refactor and
improve upon until I was happy.  That took a while.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of both the Free Software and the Open Source cultures.
(They are slightly different you know.)  I routinely work on software
with GNU GPL, MIT/X11, Apache, and ISC licenses, but for most of my
own creations I usually lean towards the very permissive
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license">ISC license</a>.  Maybe
because most of my hobby work these days are quick and dirty hacks I
don&rsquo;t really care enough about.  It&rsquo;s a question of both taste and
appropriateness &ndash; like software patents, I don&rsquo;t like them either,
but for anything which I have a great investment in, or has a great
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_originality">threshold of originality</a>,
I&rsquo;d use a more restrictive license to make sure the software is kept
in the open.</p>
<p>Anyway, I read much code, discarded several projects that were too
big, too unreadable code or simply didn&rsquo;t feel right.  I tested so
many small &ldquo;FTP&rdquo; servers that turned out to be unusable homegrown
variants or school projects.  There&rsquo;s a lot of code out there &hellip;  I
finally settled on <a href="https://github.com/xu-wang11/FtpServer">FtpServer</a>
by <a href="https://github.com/xu-wang11">Xu Wang</a> as a base for my little
project.  I suspect it too is a school project, but this one actually
worked, right off the bat!</p>
<p>I got so excited that I immediately started improving it, cleaning up
the source code, reindenting it (KNF) and fixing small bugs here and
there.  It was a perfect fit!  This is where I made my big mistake,
which I hope will not eventually kill this project in the end &ndash; the
FtpServer project did not have a license &hellip; so
<a href="https://github.com/xu-wang11/FtpServer/issues/1">I filed a bug</a> to
the GitHub issue tracker, added the ISC license to
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/uftpd">my fork</a> and continued hacking
away.  The changes I&rsquo;ve made are so substantial that there isn&rsquo;t much
left of the original code, so uftpd should be safe.  Yes, I named it
uftpd, the micro ftp server &ndash; the no nonsense file transfer protocol
daemon.</p>
<p>The whole hack took about three days and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot during
this time!  It was fun, inspiring and gave me a lot of creative energy
that I can use in other projects: at work as well as at home :)</p>
