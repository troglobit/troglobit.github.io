<p>Emacs can be quite counter intuitive and sometimes even an outright pain
to use.  I find it a shame that still today, after (literally) decades
there are no sane defaults.  Once, when I was still forced to use
Windows, I saw a setup wizard in <a href="http://ntemacs.sourceforge.net/">Win32-Emacs</a> that resembled what I

have been some extension that was maintained in some non-official
version, because now when I look for it I cannot find it.  But why not
have a setup wizard in the upstream distribution of Emacs as well?</p>
<p>Well, this is my gripe, the pieces of Emacs that are still unfriendly to
users, and mostly new users, coming from Windows or MAC.  I will use
this blog to present ideas and small things I have done to make Emacs
more user friendly.  I call this <em>Enterprise Emacs</em>.</p>
<p>Many of the following, really obvious, settings are today available in a
menu called &ldquo;Options&rdquo;, some are still buried deep within the scriptable
innards and go by unfamiliar names.</p>
<pre><code>;; Enterprise Emacs -- save this as your ~/.emacs
; Scrollbar on the *right*, or none (use 'nil for none)
(set-scroll-bar-mode 'right)

; A visible marked region
(transient-mark-mode t)

; Marking text with shift + arrow keys
(pc-selection-mode t)
(delete-selection-mode t)

; Syntax highlighting
(global-font-lock-mode t)

; A cursor that blinks so I can find it
(blink-cursor-mode t)

; A status line displaying both line *and column* of my cursor
(column-number-mode t)

; Continue at the file and position where I left off when I closed Emacs
(desktop-save-mode t)
</code></pre>
<p>In the coming months I will present some useful tips from my bag of
tricks.  Including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto-adjust as you type</li>
<li>Auto-spell as you type, text and code</li>
<li>Auto-complete words and function/method names</li>
<li>A solution to: &ldquo;Where the h-ll is that function?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Debugging from inside Emacs, like an IDE!</li>
<li>Windows-like marking, with Ctrl-x, Ctrl-v and Ctrl-v</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus the usual Emacs features that users of Microsoft products may not
have ever known.  To mention a few: complete indentation engine, with
several predefined indentation modes.  Built-in calculator (converts
between bases!)</p>
<p>The first tip is Emacs-23 with (grab on to something!)  anti-aliasing of
fonts!  Yes, it&rsquo;s still an experimental feature, and if you did not
already know this, &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; in free/open source is often quite
stable.  I have used it daily for &gt;6 months and it has crashed on me
only once.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://peadrop.com/blog/2007/01/06/pretty-emacs/">Ubuntu</a></li>
<li><a href="http://emacs.orebokech.com/">Debian</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Start off by installing it and discover the Options menu.  Then return to
this blog and I will have the next installment ready.</p>
