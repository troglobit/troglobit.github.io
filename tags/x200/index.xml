      <description>I still use my awesome little ThinkPad X200, in fact I now have more of them and even a few X201&amp;rsquo;s. They are truly the best machines I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used! :-)&#xA;One annoying thing though, when going back to these traditional ThinkPad keyboards is the prev/next keys next to the arrow keys. On modern ones they are PgUp/PgDn and I recently learned how to elegantly remap them in X. Note the difference, below, to the original at ThinkWiki.</description>

      <description>I blogged earlier about the awesome little ThinkPad X200 I found and its blinking WiFi LED. Briefly I mentioned an odd issue with X/Wayland on LMDE 4. This turned out to be a HW bug that can only be worked around by disabling hardware acceleration for virtualization:&#xA;https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Windows-8-1-8-7-Vista-and-XP-Discussions/Bizarre-screen-artifacts-on-R400-Integrated-Graphics-running-Win-7-RTM/m-p/153980?page=1#199768&#xA;The post says it should be sufficient to &amp;ldquo;Disable Virtualization Technology for Directed-IO (VT-d)&amp;rdquo;, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me, and I wanted to keep the 8 GiB of RAM I managed to fit into it.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently got my hands on a ThinkPad X200, the last model without the&#xA;useless touchpad and with the awesome classic keyboard.  A fine little&#xA;machine that can easily be upgraded with an SSD disk and 8 GiB RAM!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I set it up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php&#34;&gt;Linx Mint (LMDE 4)&lt;/a&gt;, which worked great to begin&#xA;with, but there was some odd issue with X/Wayland that sometimes caused&#xA;the screen (only the screen) to freeze up and show random color patterns.&#xA;Only way to workaround it was to suspend, wait, and resume again.  So&#xA;now I&amp;rsquo;m running Ubuntu 20.04 on it and everything seems to work a lot&#xA;better, this far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
