Welcome, my name is Joachim Nilsson and this is my blog!  I'm a hacker
and my handle is `troglobit`.  It is a tribute to my old friend Henrik
Flordal for inspiring me to become a hacker, and is also the password to
the first ever Linux server (Henrik's) I got a login to, back in 1995.

I work at [Westermo R&D][westermo] as a software architect for [WeOS][]
which is a Linux based embedded network operating system for switches
and routers.

On my spare time I write Free/Libre Open Source Software ([FLOSS][]).
For example, I maintain [Finit][], [Inadyn][], [pimd][], [mrouted][],
[SMCRoute][], [uftpd][], and more at [GitHub][].

My [GPG key][] fingerprint is `DE09 3183 2DBF 8339 191F B2B2 2C2A B0A9
6E0C 4758`.  Fetch it from a key server using:

    gpg --recv-keys 6E0C4758

Contact me as 'troglobit' at the Google mailing system.

You can find my [online resume here][resume], or download the [PDF][].
