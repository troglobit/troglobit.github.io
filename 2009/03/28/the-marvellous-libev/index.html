      <div class="post-content">
        <p>A very good friend mine recently told me about a neat event library,
<a href="http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev">libev</a>.  Usually when he drops me
links like that it takes me a couple of years to react and finally
adopt.</p>
<p>This time it only took me about a month.</p>
<p>He has actually showed me lots of very useful stuff throughout the
years, and even though we used GNU/Linux at university, he was one
those hard core people who showed me the path into a successful
full-time career as a Linux developer. I don&rsquo;t think I have ever
thanked you properly for that, Jakob!</p>
<p>As it turns out libev was exactly what I have been looking for, for
years!  Way back in 2005 when I switched jobs I started working with a
scary home brew code base ported to Linux from VxWorks.  From the
original code only the basic state machine, basic election algorithms
and some other minor glue code remains.  I have slowly refactored the
code base into something, hopefully, more maintainable.</p>
<p>The one missing piece was the timer implementation.  The old code used
to create a new pthread for each new timeout.  I tried replacing it with
code of
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/toolbox/blob/master/timer/timer.c">my own</a>,
based on Don Libes
<a href="http://www.kohala.com/start/libes.timers.txt">&ldquo;Implementing Software Timers&rdquo;</a>.
As it turns out libev already has (working) timers, in fact, it has
taken an even more complete approach and made almost everything into
events with callbacks, perfect for state machines!</p>
<p>After having done
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/toolbox/blob/master/event-demo.c">some initial testing</a>
of the libev timers I put on a big smile and fired up Emacs to
investigate what other parts of that home brew code base were eligible
for replacement, when i suddenly hit me: the state machine consists of a
couple of threads that pass messages between them using <code>msgsnd()</code> and
<code>msgrcv()</code>, bad old XSI IPC primitives.  Bad guys that don&rsquo;t use
standard file descriptors.  A quick and dirty hack confirms it. I
started looking around and I had a vague recollection of some message
primitives that actually used file descriptors.  On the mailing list
Marc (Lehman) was as always extremely quick to answer my questions and
with his help I eventually found the <code>mq_overview(7)</code> man page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Polling message queue descriptors
On Linux, a message queue descriptor is actually a file descriptor,
and can be monitored using select(2), poll(2), or epoll(7). This
is not portable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, I could hardly wait until I, later that day, could get my hands on
the keyboard again and try it out!  Yes, the POSIX message queue
primitives work!  Here is my
<a href="https://github.com/troglobit/toolbox/blob/master/event-demo2.c">sample message queue code</a>.
Compile it in Emacs with <code>M-x compile</code> (I have that bound to F9 in my
.emacs, Borland IDE style :)</p>
<p>Thus far I must say I can really recommend libev!  Even though it isn&rsquo;t
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/policy.html">ISC licensed</a>, it&rsquo;s dual licensed
under the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">2-clause BSD license</a> and
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a>.  In my case I&rsquo;ll go
with the 2-clause BSD license, which according to Wikipedia is
&ldquo;functionally equivalent&rdquo; to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a>.</p>
