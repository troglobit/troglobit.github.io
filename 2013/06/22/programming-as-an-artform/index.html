<p>Ever since I began studying Computer Engineering at <a href="http://www.mdh.se">university</a> back
in 1995 I have struggled to find the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; ways to format my code,
name functions and variables appropriately, structure functions into
files and files into directories with Makefiles and Makefile snippets,
using both recursive and non-recursive make.  Formatting of code, for
instance, was for a while a bit of an obsession of mine, and it sort of
is still.  But today I am more concerned with the overall structure and
how components interact.  Even though I can still get very annoyed at
people naming their local variables obtrusively.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practice-Programming-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/020161586X"><img src="https://troglobit.com/images/Practice_of_Programming.jpeg" style="width: 300px; float: right"></a></p>
<p>I still do most of my work, professional and hobby, using plain old C.
I&rsquo;ve read many books and style guides on the subject and the one that
really stood out as being extremely helpful, apart from reading a LOT of
code, is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practice-Programming-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/020161586X">The Practice of Programming</a> by Kernighan and Pike!  The
book is crammed full with tons of neat advice and best practises that
simly just make sense.  Stuff like &ldquo;name your local variables i, j, k
for counters and loop variables&rdquo;, which is basically what most of us do
already.  Just read it and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean &ndash; spot on!</p>
<p>Spot on?  Why should you read something that seemingly doesn&rsquo;t tell you
anything you already know?  Well, even the most evident practises often
come under scrutiny when programmers from different schools meet.  At my
job we have Microsoft, Bombardier, and ABB programmers.  All of which
have little to no experience with UNIX, Linux or any Free/Open Source
software development.  They are used to more cumbersome practises, like
&ldquo;Hungarian Style Notation&rdquo;, usually very inflexible corporate styles
which nobody can explain anymore, and so on.</p>
<p>It is difficult to teach the way of Free/Open Source software, but I
think the most important message is: keep it simple, maintain the same
style as used in the rest of the project, and if you comment then write
what you mean with a piece of code, not what it does.  And, in the true
style of UNIX, write one program that does its job well.</p>
<p>The beuty in software comes from structure, the flow, the similarities
and how the modules fit together.  The absence of duplication, and the
readability.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/practice-of-programming-9780201615869">homepage for the book</a> and download the source code to
have a look for yourself.  Enjoy!</p>
