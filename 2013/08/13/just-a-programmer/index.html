<p>I often start off with: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit complicated to explain &hellip; &ldquo;, by

<img style="float: right" src="https://troglobit.com/images/programming-in-a-nutshell.gif">
<p>In reality I&rsquo;m <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JustaProgrammer">just a programmer</a> with a little bit more
responsibility.  A day starts with coming in to the office, or sitting
down in my home office, connecting to the company VPN, meanwhile
planning loosely the day and my goals.  All while checking status of
e-mail, our IRC channel and the issue tracker for any recently
reported/updated issues in my fields of responsibility.  Somewhere
around there I have a pretty good idea about what must be done and in
what order.  So I write it down, in no particular order, on folded A4
sheets I use for TODO lists and start working.  About 20 minutes into
that, when I&rsquo;ve just reached <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?InTheZone">The Zone</a>, I get interrupted for an
impromptu meeting, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call">telco</a>, which in turn always leads to another
meeting, which in turn runs over and suddenly it&rsquo;s 16:00 (4 pm) and I
have 45 minutes to complete a days work before picking up the kids from
school.</p>
<p>Or &hellip; you can apply that same crazy to a day when trying to fix a
simple bug, finding another horrbile bug and fixing that first,
leading to a minor redesign in need of a refactor, which in turn gives
me a pain to merge since during the time I tried fixing that minor bug
my collegues have done multiple changes to the same files I&rsquo;ve been
working on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I do for a living.  And yes, I know it&rsquo;s not sustainable
work conditions.  I&rsquo;m working on that, it&rsquo;s on the TODO list &hellip;</p>
