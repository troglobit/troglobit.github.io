Ever since I first learned about [Terminator][] I've been a huge fan!
It's a great replacement for the standard [Gnome terminal][] with its
built-in support for horizontal and vertical splits.

It's not a race car though ... like Gnome terminal it's built around
libvte.  So on a bad day of clashing with Ubuntu, GDM, systemd and the
new handling of capabilities, two of my colleagues went all-in on
[Alacritty][] and now swear by it!

I tried to fall in line, but I just couldn't get it to work for me, at
all, I hated that it didn't support splits in any way!  I was also not
impressed with the lack of documentation and changing configuration file
formats that just put more roadblocks in my way.

During the winter holiday I sat down to instead learn about [Kitty][],
by Kovid Goyal, and I must say I'm very impressed and would recommend
it to anyone looking for a replacement! :-)

### Speed vs Latency

One interesting 'vs' argument when talking to Alacritty fanbois is
speed.  If the Typomenter screenshot is not enough, there's lots of good
ammunition on this [GitHub topic][].  Here are some links to get you
started:

### Kitty Config

To ease my transition from Terminator I created this configuration file:


```shell
# ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf -- Mimic the great Terminator
#
# Use Ctrl-Shift-F5 to reload the configuration at runtime.
#
# See https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/ for more information.

#
# General
#
shell_integration       disabled

#
# Window
#
remember_window_size    yes
scrollback_lines        100000

#
# Tab bar
#
tab_bar_edge            bottom
tab_bar_style           powerline
tab_powerline_style     angled

#
# Key bindings
