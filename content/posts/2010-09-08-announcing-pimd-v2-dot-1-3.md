I'm very pleased to present the next bug-fix release of [pimd][1], v2.1.3.
The real announcement for v2.1.2 I never really got around to write because
the diligent [Debian maintainer][2], [Antonin Kral][3] alerted me to some
problems.  Which is great!  I do not have the resources to test the build on
all those platforms.  I sure appreciate all the help I can get.  Thank you
Antonin!

As always, check the [homepage][1], the changelog and the GIT log for details.
