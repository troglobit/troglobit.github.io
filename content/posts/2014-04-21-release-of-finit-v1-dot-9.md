Just made it!  Here's the result of #Easterhack14 --
[Finit](/finit.html) v1.9 :-)

Nothing fancy this time, just collecting some bug fixes, playing with
cppcheck a bit and adding support for including .conf files.  Quite
useful if you want to partition your configuration, or if you share
major pieces of configuration between different platforms.

Enjoy!
