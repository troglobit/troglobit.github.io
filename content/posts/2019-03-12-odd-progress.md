A lot has happened since my last post; I had my bike stolen, stumbled
upon the guys who'd stolen it, got mugged by same guys, decided I'd had
enough and then bought a house and moved to another city.  That's the
long and short of it.

I'm OK, sort of.

Yeah, sort of ... it took a few weeks before I could sleep at all again
after it happened.  Felt like such a weight came off my shoulders when I
finally moved, four months after the mugging.  Still having real problem
sleeping though.  Usually don't get more than 6-7h, and that's on a good
night.

To top things off, the house I bought isn't really in such a great
shape.  Lots of things needs fixing, some more urgent than others.  So
at times I'm seriously questioning my decision to move.  Sure, I turned
down to a lot (!) of houses that were in worse shape than this, and I
really don't have any money saved up.  Guess I'm just worried I can't
turn things around all on my own.

This is all just doubts I carry around with me in my head.  I know I'm
fully capable of fixing most stuff, and I can break down into managable
parts the rest which I'll have to pay someone else to do.  I know this.
Shit just wears you down sometimes, you know.  So I'm taking it one day
at a time right now.  Trying to focus on things that give me energy and
motivation rather than the other way around.

It's working, sort of.
