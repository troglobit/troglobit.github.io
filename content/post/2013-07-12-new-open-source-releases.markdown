Vacation time means catching up on my Open Source projects! :)

Currently I'm shaping up the home pages and this blog to improve the
easy access and overview of all the packages I maintain.  The
following packages have new releases, or can expect new releases soon:

   * [Minix Editline](/editline.html) v1.14.1
   * [SMCRoute](/smcroute.html) v1.99.1 -- There's even a v2.0.0 being
     planned, with the core of SMCRoute available as a library
   * [mrouted](/mrouted.html) minor cleanup an sync with
     [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.sbin/mrouted/)
   * [pimd](/pimd.html) cleanups and bug fixes, needs testing
   * [inadyn](/inadyn.html) is in dire need of a release, but needs more testing and fixes

As usual, see my [GitHub](http://github.com/troglobit) for the latest
commits if you want to try anything out, file an issue report, or if
you want to contribute.
