About a year ago I wrote about a way to control the [brightness on my
x250]({{< ref "2018-08-03-brightness-on-x250.markdown" >}}).  I found a
lot of tools, and at the time I saw a lot of potential in
[light](https://github.com/haikarainen/light/), which I even contributed
to a lot.

However, I ended up not using the evolved version myself.  Took me a
while to digest what happened, but I think the project just outgrew me
and what I wanted in such a tool.

[brightnessctl](https://github.com/Hummer12007/brightnessctl/) was
another tool I had looked into, but I wanted something much simpler, so
today I wrote my own :smile:
