About a year ago I wrote about this topic, looking for a way to control
the [brightness on my x250](2018-08-03-brightness-on-x250.markdown), and
I found a lot of tools that did just this.  At the time I saw a lot of
potential in [light](https://github.com/haikarainen/light/), which I
even contributed to a lot.

However, I ended up not using the evolved version myself.  Took me a
while to digest what happened, but I think the project just outgrew me
and what I wanted in such a tool.

[brightnessctl](https://github.com/Hummer12007/brightnessctl/) was
another tool I had looked into, but I wanted something much simpler, so
today I wrote my own :smile:
