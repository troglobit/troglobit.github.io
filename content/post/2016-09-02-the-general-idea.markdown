OK, so here's the general idea: take one teaspoon of a well equipped SBC
with Marvell chips you know well, add an awesome WiFi hotspot with USB
connection, stir feverishly for several weekends in a row, then sprinkle
some AlpineLinux and a custom kernel on top.  Enjoy!

I have no clue if this will actually work, may even try porting my own
little thing called [TroglOS](https://github.com/troglobit/troglos) to
the ClearFog first, I don't know, but it will definitely be awesome!
