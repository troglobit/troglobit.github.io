Yep, we finally did it, we bought ourselves a house.  Last year in
October we moved from our small three-room flat in central Västerås to
the new house in Skultuna.  Everything went really fast from finding it
up for sale, deciding on it down to getting a loan and moving in.  Worst
part of it all was getting a decent broadband connection.  We actually
moved from a 100 Mbps dedicated copper line to a 24/2 Mbps ADSL line.
It sucks big time.  Oh well&nbsp;...
