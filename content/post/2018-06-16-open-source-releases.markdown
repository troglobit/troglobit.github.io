Last three months have been hectic, lots of exciting things going on [at
work](https://www.westermo.com), with my kids, and also with some of my
pet projects.  Here's quick update:

* [libite (-lite)](https://github.com/troglobit/libite) saw a new minor
  release of this collection of useful APIs, v2.0.2
* [tinyroot](https://github.com/troglobit/tinyroot) is a new project.  I
  started it mostly to serve as a very simple example of an embedded
  system, v2018_071
* [nemesis](https://github.com/troglobit/nemesis) is the latest stray
  I've adopeted.  It's been updated to work with the latest
  [libnet](https://github.com/sam-github/libnet) releases and seems to
  have been well received, v1.5
* [uftpd](https://github.com/troglobit/uftpd) saw a major new release,
  with lots of new features added to support streaming video to the VLC
  Android app., v2.5
* [smcroute](https://github.com/troglobit/smcroute) got a minor update
  ahead of a new upload to Debian, v2.4.1

If youâ€™re interested in my work, any of my projects, just drop me an
email or connect with me at [GitHub](https://github.com/troglobit)!
