I feel I have to write something about the demise of
[free(code)](http://freecode.com).
[Others](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5936) have written about it too,
and its been covered on [lwn.net](http://lwn.net/Articles/603403/) as
well.

It's actually a rather depressing development.  They claim it's due to
the low traffic and decline in updates, but it's evident that's not
the whole truth.  The owners recommend their other site, SourceForge,
but anyone having been in the loop for the last decade or two knows
that SourceForge has been in a slow decline for a long time, more so
than free(code) in my opinion.  Also, SourceForge only lists its own
projects, and only the most active or "top" projects.

I never used free(code) to find the "top" projects or the most active
ones.  That's completely useless to me.  I went there to dig for small
unknown projects, small gems that are usually unlisted on GitHub or
SourceForge.  I went there to publicize my own small creations, learn
about other similar projects and get a quick feedback on recent
changes of new releases to projects I was interested in.

There exist no real replacement to free(code), except perhaps for
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/), previously known as
[Ohloh](http://www.ohloh.net).  The
[Free Software Directory](http://directory.fsf.org) could perhaps have
become something over time, but unfortunately feels like yet another
[Cathedral Style](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/)
project from the FSF.  Don't get me wrong, I love the FSF and almost
everything they do, but they often get lost in their old tradition of
big closed off idealistic projects.  Eric S. Raymond has
[a proposal](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5948) for replacing free(code)
and he is that sort of pragmatic person that could get something off
the ground.  In any case it'll be interesting, I'm sure.

Some people say all the action is on GitHub these days, but that's
just like an echo of the glory days of CVS, Subversion and the start
of the new millenia when we should all use SourceForge.  Been there,
done that, and yes I do use GitHub, but again it doesn't list anything
but GitHub projects ...

Other people say that to promote your small projects you need to
become active in a Linux distro, or write about them in magazines or
on [Hacker News](http://hackerne.ws) ... well, I'd like very much to
become a Debian developer one day, but the process to become one seems
so increadibly daunting!  Also, I'm not a writer, nor am I a native
English speaker, I'm
[just a programmer](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JustaProgrammer) and I
really miss free(code)!

I don't expect this blog to have any readers at all, so using it as
the sole platform for announcing new releases is rather pointless.  So
I've started playing around with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/troglobit) for my own most
relevant projects.  It has some nice stats and other useful features
that I can use.  Hopefully it can serve as a replacement for my most
basic needs.
