The last couple of months have been crazy.  The downturn in the economy
due to Covid-19, mass layoffs, social distancing and quarantine.  Not
to mention the unrest in US and Europe in the wake of George Floyd's
uneccessary death.

I've always been a bit of a misanthrope and indoor enthusiast, keeping
to myself and working on my own stuff.  But even I have to admit to
being quite worried about the world in general and have cried on more
than one occasion.

I've been channeling all these feelings into my work, primarily all my
Open Source projects.  Over just the last couple of weeks the following
new releases have hit [GitHub](https://github.com/troglobit), my
[FTP](https://ftp.troglobit.com), and my new [.deb
repository](https://deb.troglobit.com):

  * [sysklogd v2.1.2](https://github.com/troglobit/sysklogd/releases/tag/v2.1.2)
  * [-lite v2.2.0](https://github.com/troglobit/libite/releases/tag/v2.2.0)
  * [mdnsd v0.10](https://github.com/troglobit/mdnsd/releases/tag/v0.10)
  * [uftpd v2.12](https://github.com/troglobit/uftpd/releases/tag/v2.12)
  * [In-a-Dyn v2.7](https://github.com/troglobit/inadyn/releases/tag/v2.7)
  * [netcalc v2.1.6](https://github.com/troglobit/netcalc/releases/tag/v2.1.6)
  * ssdp-responder v1.6, and
  * [ssdp-responder v1.7](https://github.com/troglobit/ssdp-responder/releases/tag/v1.7)
  * [The Nemesis Project v1.7](https://github.com/troglobit/nemesis/releases/tag/v1.7)
  * [mrouted v4.0](https://github.com/troglobit/mrouted/releases/tag/4.0)

I'm most proud of the [mrouted](/projects/mrouted/) release, because
it's the culmination of over 10 years of hard work since I first adopted
it.  It's been a wild ride and I've learned a LOT!
