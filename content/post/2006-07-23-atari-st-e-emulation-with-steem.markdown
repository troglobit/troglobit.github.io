This is is really great!  Today, on my 32nd birthday I found a really
golden piece of software - [Steem][1] - even though it's not
[free software][2], it has a Linux port which runs almost all of my
alltime Atari ST classics: Thrust, Virus, Speedball I & II, Xenon I &
II, Great Giana Sisters, The Union Demo, The "Oh crikey what a scorcer"
demo, Nebulus and lots more!

Since today is also my birthday I received a gift.  It was my [wife][3]
and my [daughter][4] who had bought a Black & Decker grass trimmer. :-)
My daughter had also selected a fine bunch of red carnations.  Now I can
finally take care of all the weed and long grass at the back of the
house.
