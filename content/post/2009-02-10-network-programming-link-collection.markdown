title: Netork Programming -- Link Collection
url: /2009/02/10/network-programming-link-collection/
---

This is a first effort at collecting information about network
programming structs and APIs available in UNIX.  I plan on updating this
as I find more.

* Linux Journal: Linux Network Programming, Part
  [I](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2333),
  [II](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2335),
  [III](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2336).
* Linux Journal:
  [Multicast Routing Code in the Linux Kernel](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6070)
* Linux Journal: Inside the Linux Packet Filter, Part
  [I](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4852),
  [II](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5617)
* /usr/include/netinet/in.h 

There are of course, in addition to these fine sources, the entire
catalogue of work by [Richard M. Stevens](http://kohala.com/start/).
May he rest in peace.  His works are considered *the* reference
litterature on this subject, see for instance the
[UNIX Network Programming](http://www.unpbook.com)
([review](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2656)).
