From time to time, even though it seems to occur more frequently these
days, I think about the persistence of things.  How development is
continuously accelerating in the modern world.  To me this is like a
double edged sword, it's both comforting and unsettling.  Comforting
that we as humans continuously improve and develop our methods and
technologies.  Unsettling because I know much of the development is in
directions that I don't approve of: more intricate and capable weapons
and methods of surveillance.  Yet somehow we manage to survive and
thrive in our lives.  Life finds a way, I guess.
