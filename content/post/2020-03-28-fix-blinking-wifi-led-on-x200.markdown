title: Fix blinking WiFi LED on X200

Recently got my hands on a ThinkPad X200, the last model without the
useless touchpad and with the awesome classic keyboard.  A fine little
machine that can easily be upgraded with an SSD disk and 8 GiB RAM!

I set it up with [Linx Mint (LMDE 4)][1], which worked great to begin
with, but there was some odd issue with X/Waland that sometimes caused
the screen (only the screen) to freeze up and show random color patterns.
Only way to workaround it was to suspend, wait, and resume again.  So
now I'm running Ubuntu 20.04 on it and everything seems to work a lot
better, this far.

One really annoying thing is the WiFi LED blinking like crazy.  Very
disturbing when you're working on something. 

Turns out it was quite easy to fix.  Create the following file, or
modify it if it exists already (Ubuntu), so that the first line after
comments is this:

```
# sudo editor /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf
options iwlwifi led_mode=1
```

Reboot et voil√†! \o/
