First try to consolidate on using an already working implementation of a
blog script rather than writing my own.  I'm trying out Blosxom, which
is somewhat overkill for my needs.  I actually wrote up a simple Perl
script a couple of weeks ago that did what I wanted, oh well, what
remains now is to do some Emacs hacks to smooth things over a bit.
