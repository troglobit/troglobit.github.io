Ever so often, as I have mentioned before, I lose myself in trying to
find new ways of working and doing my daily tasks.  One such digression
is the topic of editors.  I mainly use GNU Emacs for development and
other major tasks, for everything else I use Vim.

Vim is quick to start, capable, good looking and easy to use, contrary
to other vi implementations. (Most notably nvi, which I hate with a
passion!) Today I found a neat colorscheme that works well on terminals
with a black background. It's called 'advantage' and is available from
the [Vim Color Scheme Test][1].

To install, download `advantage.vim` and copy it to your
`/usr/share/vim/vim71/colors/` directory.  Then open a C source file in
vim and type `:colorscheme advantage` to activate it.

Thank you [Shan Leung Maverick Woo][2]! :-)
