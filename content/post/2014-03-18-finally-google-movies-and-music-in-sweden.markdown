So, we finally got Google Music & Movies services in Sweden!  The
prices seem a bit on the steep side, apart from maybe the Music
service, which is slightly cheaper than Spotify.  Will try it out for
a month or so to see which one I like better.

For some reason I chose Gravity as my first rental, at 39 Skr.  I've
heard so many bad reviews of it but for better or worse it'll now be
my introduction to Google Movies :-)
