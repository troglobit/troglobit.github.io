Nemesis is a command-line network packet crafting and injection utility
for UNIX-like and Windows systems.  Well suited for testing Network
Intrusion Detection Systems, firewalls, IP stacks and a variety of other
tasks.  As a command-line driven utility, it is perfect for automation
and scripting.

Nemesis can natively craft and inject ARP, DNS, ETHERNET, ICMP, IGMP,
IP, OSPF, RIP, TCP and UDP packets.  Using the IP and the Ethernet
injection modes, almost any custom packet can be crafted and injected.
