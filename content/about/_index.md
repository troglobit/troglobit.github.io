Welcome to this blog, I'm Joachim Wiberg[^1]!  It serves as a tribute to
my childhood friend Henrik Flordal, for inspiring me to become a hacker.
The nick is also the first password I got to a Linux server (Henrik's),
back in 1995.  I set this up ages ago in an attempt to apologize for my
DDOS:ing his server because I had yet to learn about `/etc/motd`.  We
have not spoken since, unfortunately &#128148;

So yes, I'm a huge Linux and UNIX nerd.  Ever since my first job, after
[graduating from MdU][resume], I've (only) been running Linux on almost
all my machines (some run BSD or UNIX though) including work.  In the
beginning (1998-2000) it was hard, and even actively discouraged by
management and IT departments, but I persevered (made them see the
light) and got Linux into many organizations over the years &#128170;

For a very long time I worked at [Westermo R&D][westermo] as a software
architect for [WeOS][], a Linux-based network operating system for
switches and routers that I created 2005-2007 for them, which since has
grown up considerably &#129327;

Today I work at [&#128423; Wires](https://wires.se) in V&auml;ster&aring;s,
Sweden, as a software architect and embedded systems consultant.  My
specialty is networking solutions and embedded Linux, preferably based
on [Infix][] or [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org).  I spend most of my
waken time on the [KernelKit projects, primarily Infix NOS][kkit].  This
time around, the OS is based on Buildroot and completely modeled with
[YANG][].

My spare time is spent with my kids and cat, but I also maintain quite a
few Free/Libre Open Source Software ([FLOSS][]) project.  For example,
[Finit][], [Inadyn][], [pimd][], [pimd-dense][], [mrouted][],
[SMCRoute][], [sysklogd][], [uftpd][], and more at [GitHub][].

My [GPG key][] fingerprint is `4A11 E139 3486 34EF 499C ECAC ECA8 26A3
7B6C 7409`.  Fetch it from a key server using:

    gpg --recv-keys ECA826A37B6C7409

You can find my [online resume here][resume], or download the [PDF][].
