Welcome to this little blog, my name is Joachim Wiberg, formerly
Nilsson.  The nick `troglobit` is a tribute to my childhood friend
Henrik Flordal, for being a good friend and inspiring me to become a
hacker.  It is also the first password to a Linux server (Henrik's) I
got a login to, back in 1995.

So yes, I'm a huge Linux and UNIX nerd.  Ever since my first job, after
[graduating from MdU][resume], I've been running Linux on almost all my
machines, including those at work.  In the beginning (2000) it was hard
and even actively discouraged by management and IT departments, but I
made it work and set the bar for others to follow!

Today I work a [Addiva Elektronik](https://addiva.se) in Västerås,
Sweden, as a software architect and embedded systems consultant.  My
specialty is networking solutions and embedded Linux, preferably
[Buildroot](https://buildroot.org).  For very a long time I worked at
[Westermo R&D][westermo] as a software architect for [WeOS][], a
Linux-based network operating system for switches and routers.

In my spare time I write Free/Libre Open Source Software ([FLOSS][]).
For example, I maintain [Finit][], [Inadyn][], [pimd][], [mrouted][],
[SMCRoute][], [sysklogd][], [uftpd][], and more at [GitHub][].
